/// Represents the claims contained within an Access Token.
///
/// An `AccessToken` is a token used to authorize access to protected resources.
/// It typically contains a set of claims that describe the tokenâ€™s purpose, issuer,
/// and expiration. This struct is used to deserialize and validate the claims
/// present in the JWT access token.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `aud`: The audience for which the token is intended. It typically represents
///    the identifier of the recipient or service that should accept the token.
/// - `exp`: The expiration time (in seconds since the Unix epoch) after which the token is no longer valid.
/// - `iat`: The issued-at time (in seconds since the Unix epoch) when the token was created.
/// - `iss`: The issuer of the token, typically a URL representing the authorization server.
/// - `jti`: A unique identifier for the token, often used to prevent token reuse.
/// - `scope`: The scope of the access granted by the token, typically a space-separated string representing permissions.
