# Security Policy

The **JanssenProject** team and community take security bugs seriously.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported versions

Security updates will typically only be applied to the latest release (at least until **Janssen** reaches first stable major version).

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| >=0.1 | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security issue, email [security@jans.io](mailto:security@jans.io?subject=SECURITY)
and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The **Janssen** team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Note also that the team can use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories)
to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability you responsibly reported to us.
