# Key Generation 

## Generating Cryptographic Keys

The Jans Server is compatible with the [Java KeyGenerator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyGenerator.html) to create new cryptographic keys if needed.

### Backup

* Backup `jansConfWebKeys` attribute data from LDAP. Location of this attribute is: `o=jans > ou=configuration > ou=jans-auth`
* Backup `jans-auth-keys.p12` from `/etc/certs/`

[N.B] Below if `Keystore` location is anywhere except `/etc/certs/` no need to backup.

### Key Generate
To get KeyGenerator, run the following command inside the terminal.

You can put expiration according to your own policy. For testing purpose we are keeping it 2 days.

```commandLine
/opt/jre/bin/java -Dlog4j.defaultInitOverride=true -cp /opt/dist/jans/jans-auth-client-jar-with-dependencies.jar io.jans.as.client.util.KeyGenerator -keystore /etc/certs/jans-auth-keys.p12 -keypasswd <Password> -sig_keys RS256 RS384 -enc_keys RSA1_5 RSA-OAEP -key_ops_type ALL -dnname "CN=jansAuth CA Certificates" -expiration 2 > /etc/certs/jans-auth-keys.json
```

!!! Note
    `-key_ops_type ALL` parameter which sets purpose of the keys generated by key generator.

Possible values are:

- "connect" - connect keys (that is what we already have)
- "ssa" - ssa keys which has expiration set to 50 years (it ignores "expiration" parameters)
- "all" - generate both "connect" and "ssa" keys. Usually should be done during initial setup.

Lets see our newly generated crypto keys

```commandLine
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/certs/jans-auth-keys.p12 -storetype pkcs12 -storepass <password>
```

The jans implementation of KeyGenerator accepts the following arguments:
