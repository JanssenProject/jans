## OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests

Rich Authorization Requests introduces new `authorization_details` parameter that is used to carry fine-grained authorization data in OAuth messages.

While `scope` is used for coarse-grained access, `authorization_details` is used for fine-grained access.

`authorization_details` are associated with authorization and thus with client to limit what authorization can be granted within given client.

`authorization_details` is JSON array, example:

```json
[
   {
      "type": "demo_authz_detail",
      "actions": [
          "list_accounts",
          "read_balances"
      ],
      "locations": [
          "https://example.com/accounts"
      ],
      "ui_representation": "Read balances and list accounts at https://example.com/accounts"
   },
   {
       "type":"financial-transaction",
       "actions":[
           "withdraw"
       ],
       "identifier":"account-14-32-32-3",
       "currency":"USD"
   }
]
```

### Authorization Details Types

`type` - is required element in single authorization detail and specifies the authorization details type as a string.
Type defines how single authorization detail is handled by both AS and RS. 
Because "shape" and structure of single authorization detail can vary a lot, validation and representation logic is externalized to `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts.

`type` defines type of authorization detail. Each such type is represented by AS `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts.
It means that for example above administrator must define two `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts with names: `demo_authz_detail` and `financial-transaction`. 

If `authorization_details` parameter is absent in request then `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts are not invoked. 

`demo_authz_detail` and `financial-transaction` `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts must be provided by administrator.

- `demo_authz_detail` is called for all authorization details with `"type": "demo_authz_detail"`
- `financial-transaction` is called for all authorization details with `"type": "financial-transaction"`

Sample Authorization Request
```
POST /jans-auth/restv1/authorize HTTP/1.1
Host: yuriyz-fond-skink.gluu.info

response_type=code&client_id=7a29bf35-96ec-4bbd-a05c-15e1ff9f07cc&scope=openid+profile+address+email+phone+user_name&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fyuriyz-relaxed-jawfish.gluu.info%2Fjans-auth-rp%2Fhome.htm&state=6cdc7701-178c-4653-adac-5c1e9c6c4aba&nonce=b9a1ecc4-548e-475c-8b29-f019417e1aef&prompt=&ui_locales=&claims_locales=&acr_values=&request_session_id=false&authorization_details=%5B%0A++%7B%0A++++%22type%22%3A+%22demo_authz_detail%22%2C%0A++++%22actions%22%3A+%5B%0A++++++%22list_accounts%22%2C%0A++++++%22read_balances%22%0A++++%5D%2C%0A++++%22locations%22%3A+%5B%0A++++++%22https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Faccounts%22%0A++++%5D%2C%0A++++%22ui_representation%22%3A+%22Read+balances+and+list+accounts+at+https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Faccounts%22%0A++%7D%0A%5D
```

Request is rejected if request's `authorization_details` has types which does not have corresponding `AuthzDetailType` custom script. 

Check more details about [`AuthzDetailType` custom scripts](../../developer/scripts/authz-detail.md)  

### AS Metadata (Discovery)

Metadata endpoint has `authorization_details_types_supported` which shows supported authorization details types.
Value for `authorization_details_types_supported` is populated based on valid and enabled `AuthzDetailType` insterception scripts.

For `demo_authz_detail` and `financial-transaction` `AuthzDetailType` custom scripts enabled discovery response has:

```text
{
    "authorization_details_types_supported" : [ "demo_authz_detail", "financial-transaction" ],
    ...
}
```
  
### Client Registration

Client registration request has new parameter `authorization_details_types` to limit authorization details types supported by client.
If request is made with `authorization_details` that has types that are not listed in client's `authorization_details_types` the request will be rejected.
