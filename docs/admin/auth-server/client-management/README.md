## Background

A "client" is a piece of software either acting autonomously or on behalf of
a person. The OAuth framework defines the term client
[here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.1). OpenId Connect
[clarifies](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Introduction)
that:
`OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs)`

Don't confuse a client with either the Person or the Browser!

## Client Security

OpenID allows you to use as much security as you need. To a large extent, how
the client is configured equals how secure is your OpenID implementation. For
example, let's just consider how the client authenticates itself to Jans Auth
Server, which is defined by the `token_endpoint_auth_method` in OpenID Connect
as a [Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata) claim.

| Method | Secret Not Sent in Clear | Signed | Only client has secret |
| ------ | :----------------------: | :----: | :--------------------- |
| `client_secret_basic` |   |   |   |
| `client_secret_post`  |   |   |   |
| `client_secret_jwt`   | X | X |   |
| `private_key_jwt`     | X | X | X |

Obviously, using asynchronous secrets for authentication is more secure. The
client configuration also determines what crypto is used for signing and
encryption of tokens, what scopes are available to the client (which determines
the extent of access to APIs), what grants are available, and what is a valid
`redirect_uri` to redirect the browser to after a front channel interaction
with Jans Auth Server. Through client configuration, you can also control other
behavior, like timeouts, interception script executions, whether to use a value
or reference token, whether to expire the client, and several other options that
impact security.

## Client Tools

Jan Auth Server client management enables admins to create (register), update,
remove and get information about clients.

There are a few ways clients are created and managed in Jans Auth Server:

* [Jans Config API](../../config-guide/config-api/)
* [Command Line Tool (CLI)]((../../config-guide/jans-cli/README.md))
* [Jans Text UI (TUI)](../../config-guide/tui.md)
* [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)

Which mechanism to use depends on the deployment requirements. For *ad hoc*
creation, the TUI is great. If you need to quickly script client creation (e.g.
in a bash script), use the CLI, or use `curl` to call the Jans Config API.  If
developers need to have the ability to register clients, the adopt OpenID
Connect Dynamic Client Registration.

### OpenID Dynamic Client Registration

Jans Auth server publishes the `registration_endpoint` in the OpenID
configuration JSON response, which you can find at `.well-known/openid-configuration`
in your specific deployment. Typically, it is
`https://{hostname}/jans-auth/restv1/register`

The OpenApi specification for [/registration](https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/vreplace-janssen-version/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml#/Registration) documents Jans Auth Server's specific implementation,
which aligns with the requirements of OpenID Connect dynamic client
registration. Also check the
[Registration Endpoint documentation](../endpoints/client-registration.md) for
more details on the steps involved in dynamic client registration.

### Jans-CLI

Below is a one liner to add a client.

```
./config-cli-tui.pyz --host $FQDN --client-id $MY_CLIENT_ID \
--client-secret $MY_CLIENT_SECRET --no-tui \
--operation-id=post-oauth-openid-client  --data=my_client.json
```

For more information about how to use
the Jans-CLI, see the [docs](../../config-guide/jans-cli/README.md)

### Using TUI

To start registering a new client, navigate to
`Auth Server`->`Clients`->`Add Client`.  This brings up a screen as show below
with various sections to input client details.

### Using curl

To add a client via `curl`, see information on the
[curl documentation page](../../config-guide/curl.md).
