# Software Statements

Software Statement is defined by OAuth dynamic client registration RFC
[7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591#section-1.2) as

```
A digitally signed or MACed JSON Web Token (JWT) 
that asserts metadata values about the client software.
```

Janssen Server supports usage of software statements during dynamic client registration and as a client identifier
in absence of prior client registration.

## Use During Dynamic Client Registration

Janssen Server supports dynamic client registration using software statements. It can be
[used as software statements](./../../auth-server/endpoints/client-registration.md#using-software-statement) or
[as software statement assertions (SSA)](../../auth-server/endpoints/client-registration.md#special-mention-about-fapi)
to register client dynamically.

Janssen Server also provides [SSA endpoint](../../auth-server/endpoints/ssa.md) to create and manage SSAs on the server.
