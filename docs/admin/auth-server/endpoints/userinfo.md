# Overview

Userinfo endpoint is an OAuth2 protected endpoint that is used to retrieve claims about an authenticated end-user.
Userinfo endpoint is defined in the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).

URL to access userinfo endpoint on Janssen Server is listed in the response of Janssen Server's well-known 
[configuration endpoint](./configuration.md) given below. 

```text
https://<jans-server-host>/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

`userinfo_endpoint` claim in the response specifies the URL for userinfo endpoint. By default, userinfo endpoint looks
like below:

```
https://janssen.server.host/jans-auth/restv1/userinfo
```

In response to a valid request, the userinfo endpoint returns user information in JSON format similar to below:

Since userinfo endpoint is an OAuth2 protected resource, a valid access token with appropriate scope is required to 
access the endpoint. More information about request and response of the userinfo endpoint can be found in 
the OpenAPI specification of [jans-auth-server module](https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/replace-janssen-version/jans-auth-server/docs/swagger.yaml#/User_Info).
