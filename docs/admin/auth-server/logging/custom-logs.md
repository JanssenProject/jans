# Customize logs

Sometimes it can be useful to customize logging behavior or override AS loggers. 
It is possible to fully override AS logging configuration by specifying own `log4j2.xml` file in `externalLoggerConfiguration` AS configuration property.
It must point to valid `log4j2.xml` file. 

Note: invalid external `log4j2.xml` can lead to AS start up issues and no logs in [standard log files](standard-logs.md) or otherwise in other log files if such are defined by `log4j2.xml`.
