# Subject identifiers

Subject identifiers(defined in
[OpenID Connect Core SPEC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology)) are unique identifiers
generated by Janssen Server(i.e. OpenId Provider) for an end-user. Subject identifiers are unique per Janssen Server
instance and it is shared with the client (or clients) via ID token or access token. Whether the same subject identifier
is used for the same end-user across multiple clients depends on the kind of subject identifier configured for a particular
client.

## Types of Subject Identifiers

Janssen Server supports both subject identifier types, `public` and `pairwise`, as specified in OpenID Connect
specification. For a particular Janssen Server deployment, the supported types are listed in the response of Janssen
Server's well-known configuration endpoint is given below.

```
https://janssen.server.host/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The `subject_types_supported` claim in the response specifies the list of all the supported types.

More details about both types are given in
[this section](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of specification.

## Public Subject Identifiers

Public subject identifiers are identifiers that the server generates and assigns to each subject. These identifiers are
unique for each server deployment. All the clients that are configured to use a `public` type subject identifier will
be supplied this same identifier for a given subject by the Janssen Server.

Sharing common subject identifiers across multiple clients may enable clients to correlate data about a particular
subject. If this is an unwanted situation, then the client should use [pairwise](#pairwise-subject-identifiers)
subject identifiers.

By default, the Janssen Server uses the subject attribute `inum` as the subject identifier.

### Customizing Subject Identifier Attribute

At the server level, the administrator specifies which subject attribute should be used as subject identifiers.
This can be done by updating the value of
[openidSubAttribute](../../reference/json/properties/janssenauthserver-properties.md#openidsubattribute)
Janssen Server property.

At the client level, this can be further customized. If a client uses `public` type subject identifier, the client can
configure the subject attribute that should be used as a subject identifier. This should be done at the client
registration time.

To enable client level customization, the Janssen Server property
[publicSubjectIdentifierPerClientEnabled](../../reference/json/properties/janssenauthserver-properties.md#publicsubjectidentifierperclientenabled)
should be set to `true` and also the desired attribute should be part of the list
defined by the Janssen Server property
[subjectIdentifiersPerClientSupported](../../reference/json/properties/janssenauthserver-properties.md#subjectidentifiersperclientsupported).
Both these properties can be set by the administrator using [TUI](../../config-guide/jans-tui/README.md).

## Pairwise Subject Identifiers

When a client chooses to use `pairwise` subject identifier, the Janssen Server generates and attaches a new identifier
to all the subjects requested by the client. This identifier is consistently used for the subject-client pair and never
used for any other clients configured on the Janssen Server. If multiple clients are using `pairwise` type subject
identifiers, then the same subject will have different identifiers for each subject.

Since every client has a different identifier for the same subject, the clients can't match identifiers and correlate
information about a subject out of the band.

### Pairwise Identifier Generation

Janssen Server uses host name string from redirect URI or sector identifier, local user ID, and a salt string as
initial inputs to generate pairwise identifiers. This input is then signed with the HS256 signing algorithm to generate
a pairwise identifier.

Sector identifier configuration influences how pairwise identifiers are calculated. See
[this](../client-management/sector-identifiers.md) document for more details.
