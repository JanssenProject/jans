# Subject identifiers

Subject identifiers(defined in [OpenID Connect Core SPEC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology)) are unique identifiers generated by Janssen Server(i.e. OpenId Provider) for an end-user. Subject identifiers are unique per Janssen Server instance and it is shared with the client (or clients) via ID token or access token. Whether the same subject identifier is used for same end-user across multiple clients depends on the kind of subject identifier configured for a particular client.

## Types of Subject Identifiers

Janssen Server supports both subject identifier types, `public` and `pairwise`, as specidifed in OpenID Connect specification. Further for a particular Janssen Server the supported types of subject identifiers are listed in the response of Janssen Server's well-known configuration endpoint given below.

```
https://janssen.server.host/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The `subject_types_supported` claim in the response specifies the list of all the supported types. 

More details about both types are given in [this section](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of specification.
