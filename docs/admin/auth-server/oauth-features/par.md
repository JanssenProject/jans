# Pushed Authorization Request (PAR)

Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) allows to push the payload of an OAuth 2.0 authorization request to the authorization server via 
a direct request and provides back with a request URI that is used as reference to the data in a subsequent call to the authorization endpoint.

For more information and implementation details please check [PAR Endpoint documentation](../endpoints/par.md)

[PAR specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126)
