# Janssen CLI

`jans-cli` module is a command line interface for configuring the Janssen software, providing both interactive and simple single line options for configuration. This module interacts with Janssen server via RESTful configuration APIs that server exposes. Using these REST APIs, `jans-cli` allows configuration of authorization server and its major modules for FIDO2, SCIM, OpenID Connect etc.

Using this mode is more difficult than the TUI. If needed, help options are available by typing:  

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --help
```

It will print all information about how to configure Janssen Server using CLI mode:

```

  --patch-replace PATCH_REPLACE
                        Colon delimited key:value pair for replace patch

```
We start with getting information about tasks, tasks are options of argument `--info`:

```
Attribute, CacheConfiguration, CacheConfigurationInMemory, CacheConfigurationMemcached, CacheConfigurationNativePersistence, CacheConfigurationRedis, ConfigurationFido2, ConfigurationJWKJSONWebKeyJWK, ConfigurationLogging, ConfigurationProperties, ConfigurationSMTP, CustomScripts, DatabaseCouchbaseConfiguration, DatabaseLDAPConfiguration, DefaultAuthenticationMethod, OAuthOpenIDConnectClients, OAuthOpenIDConnectSectorIdentifiers, OAuthScopes, OAuthUMAResources
```

To get information for a specific task we run command as below: 
```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --info [task]
``` 
for example: 
```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --info DefaultAuthenticationMethod
``` 

It returns with some `operation id`:
```
Operation ID: get-acrs
  Description: Gets default authentication method.
Operation ID: put-acrs
  Description: Updates default authentication method.
  Schema: /components/schemas/AuthenticationMethod

To get sample shema type /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --schema <schma>, for example /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --schema /components/schemas/AuthenticationMethod
```
To perform any operation, you have to run command line with the operation id. for example:

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-acrs
```
It returns:

```text
Getting access token for scope https://jans.io/oauth/config/acrs.readonly
{
  "defaultAcr": "simple_password_auth"
}
```

This is how we can execute single line command to get information about the Janssen Server. 


## Basic command-line switches

1. `-h` or `--help` to get all the formations of command line argument (ex; `/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py -h`)
2. `--info` to get formations about some operations id for a specific task (ex; `opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --info User`)
3. `--operation-id` usage to operate each of the sub-task
4. `--endpoint-args` advanced usage for operation-id
5. `--data` usage to share data in operations


## Patch Request (schema)

This schema file can be found in `/components/schemas/PatchRequest` for those which one support this operation.

When you examine this sample schema, you will see three properties in an object: op, path, and value.

* __op__: operation to be done, one of `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, `test`
* __path__: Path of the property to be changed. use path separator `/` for config or `.` for SCIM to change a property inside an object.
* __value__: New value to be assigned for each property defined in `path`

## Multiple Patch Request (schema)

When we need to perform multiple patch operations on any configuration endpoint, Instead of doing one by one, we can create a json file including all individual operation into an array. To clarify, please see below json file:


```
[
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "Value"
    },
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    },
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    }
    ...
    ...
    ...
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    }
]
```

This file contains multiple individual patch operation. In [Patch Request (schema)](cli-index.md#patch-request-schema) we explained about each of these keys in the above json file.

After creating the json file, just run the patch operation command.

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id [patch operation id name] --data [json file absolute url]
```

## Quick Patch Operations

There is another patch request feature. It is a single line patch-request command line. It supports three types of operations:

- `patch-replace`: to replace value with new one.
- `patch-add`: it will add value into the key path.
- `patch-remove`: to remove value from any key path.

The command line looks like below:

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id [patch-operation-id] --[patch-operation-name] key:value
```

for example:

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id patch-config-cache --patch-replace memcachedConfiguration/bufferSize:32788
```

In this command line:
- `patch-config-cache` is a operation-id from *Cache Configurations* task.
- `patch-replace` type of operation; used to replace values in
- `memcachedConfiguration/bufferSize:32788` is a `key:value` pair

## CLI Authorization
To run operations on Janssen Server, CLI client will need to be authenticated and authorized by the server. Since CLI has limited input capabilities, it uses [Device Authorization Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628) flow to get required permissions in form of an access token. After successfully receiving the token, CLI can run operations on the Janssen server while the token is valid. The steps below will summarize this process.

1. Execution of CLI command will return the following message if a valid token is not found.
   ```
   Access token was not found.
   Please visit verification url <Janssen-server-device-code-url> and enter user code CGFZ-RTZR in 1800 seconds
   Please press <<Enter>> when ready
   ```
2. Take `<Janssen-server-device-code-url>` from the message above and use any browser to access it from a different device
3. User will be presented with a page where the user has to authenticate using id and password
4. After successful user authentication, the next screen allows the user to enter the user code. Use the user code presented on command-line instruction in step 1 above.
5. After successful code validation, the user is presented with OAuth permissions screen. This screen would list all the permissions requested by Jans CLI. The user can choose to `Allow` or `Not Allow` granting of these permissions.
6. After allowing the grant of requested permissions, the user should come back to the command-line interface and hit <<Enter>> as instructed. This will enable CLI to run operations on the corresponding Janssen server.
