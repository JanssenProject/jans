    The interactive mode of the CLI will be deprecated upon the full release of the Configuration TUI in the coming months.

Sometimes It's getting hard to change **Default Authentication Method** from a web browser if you can't log in using the web interface. Here Janssen CLI is going to help you a lot.

Select option 2 from Main Menu to chose Authentication Method. You can see such options as listed above.
