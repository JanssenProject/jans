# SCIM-CLI

SCIM is a specification designed to reduce the complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and the patterns for exchanging such schema using HTTP in a platform-neutral fashion. The aim of SCIM is achieving interoperability, security, and scalability in the context of identity management.

**SCIM-CLI** which is going to help on performing such SCIM operations on the Janssen Server with ease and more readability. It supports both of the [Menu-driven Interactive Mode](jans-cli/im/im-index.md) and [Command Line Mode](jans-cli/cli-index.md).
