# SCIM-CLI

SCIM is a specification designed to reduce the complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and the patterns for exchanging such schema using HTTP in a platform-neutral fashion. The aim of SCIM is achieving interoperability, security, and scalability in the context of identity management.

**SCIM-CLI** which is going to help on performing such SCIM operations on the Janssen Server with ease and more readability. It supports [Command Line Mode](jans-cli/README.md).
