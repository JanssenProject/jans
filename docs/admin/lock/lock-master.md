# Lock Master

## Jans Lock Overview

Lock Master is a Java Weld application that connects ephemeral Cedarlings to the enterprise by 
providing a number of [endpoints](https://gluu.org/swagger-ui/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/jans-lock/lock-master.yaml)

## Installation 

Admins can deploy Lock Master as part of Jans Auth Server or as a stanalone 
web server.

## Configuration 

A list of server-level configuration properties.

## Logs 

Lock Master creates the following logs:

* lock_master_config.log
* lock_master_audit.log -- RDBMS option
* lock_master_jwt_status.log 

## CLI / TUI 

Admins can manage Lock Master runtime configuration and see activity using the 
Jans CLI or TUI.

- Create/Read/Update/Delete Policy Stores
- Total Number of Authz requests per day
- View/Search current Cedarling clients by searching for username
    - View authz activity for this Cedarling client

## OAuth Security

Cedarling should present an SSA during client registration. This will enable 
Cedarlings to obtain access tokens with scopes for OAuth protected Lock Master 
endpoints.
