# Properties And Feature Flags

Janssen Server configuration is driven by [properties](./properties/README.md) and [feature flags](./feature-flags/README.md). While properties drive behaviour of Janssen Server at more granular level, the feature flags are used to enable/disable functionalities at the server level.

Janssen Server uses JSON format to store properties and feature flag configuration for any deployment. Administrators can use [CLI](../../config-guide/jans-cli/README.md) or [TUI](../../config-guide/jans-tui/README.md) to configure available properties and feature flags.

Use the left navigation panel to browse complete list of available properties and feature flags across all Janssen Server modules.
