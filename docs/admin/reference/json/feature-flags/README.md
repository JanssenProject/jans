# Feature Flags

Janssen Server provides feature flags that the administrator can use to enable or disable the entire feature. For
example, many endpoints exposed by Janssen Server can be disabled by the administrator using feature flags.

Navigate through the left navigation panel to see the complete list of feature flags available in Janssen Server.

## Using Feature Flags

An administrator can enable or disable feature flags using [TUI](../../../config-guide/jans-tui/README.md). New value
of the feature flag will be dynamically loaded at an interval of 30 seconds.
