# Red Hat EL Janssen Installation

Before you install, check the [VM system requirements](vm-requirements.md).

## Supported versions
- Red Hat Enterprise Linus 8 (RHEL 8)
- CentOS 8

## Install the Package


- Download the release package from the Github Janssen Project
  [Releases](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases)

```
wget https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases/download/v1.0.4/jans-1.0.4-el8.x86_64.rpm -P ~/
```

- Verify integrity of the downloaded package using published `sha256sum`.

    Download `sha256sum` file for the package

    ```shell
    wget https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases/download/v1.0.4/jans-1.0.4-el8.x86_64.rpm.sha256sum -P ~/
    ```

    Check the hash if it is matching.

    ```shell
    sha256sum -c jans-1.0.4-el8.x86_64.rpm.sha256sum
    ```

    Output similar to below should confirm the integrity of the downloaded package.

    ```text
    <package-name>: OK
    ```
  
- Install the package

```
yum install ~/jans-1.0.4-el8.x86_64.rpm
```

## Run the setup script

- Run the setup script in interactive mode:

```
sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.py
```

The installer should confirm successful installation with a message similar
to the one shown below:

![](../../../assets/image-jans-install-success.png)

See more detailed [instructions](../setup.md) on the setup script if you're
confused how to answer any of the questions, for details about command line
arguments, or you would prefer to use a properties file instead of
interactive mode.

## Verify the Installation

After the successful completion of setup process, [verify the system health](../install-faq.md#after-installation-how-do-i-verify-that-the-janssen-server-is-up-and-running).
