## Run the setup script

- Run the setup script in interactive mode:

```
python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.py
```

See more detailed [instructions](../setup.md) on the setup script if you're
confused how to answer any of the questions, for details about command line
arguments, or you would prefer to use a properties file instead of
interactive mode.

## Verify the Installation

After the successful completion of setup process, [verify the system health](../install-faq.md#after-installation-how-do-i-verify-that-the-janssen-server-is-up-and-running).

## Log in to Text User Interface (TUI)

Begin configuration by accessing the TUI with the following command:

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/jans_cli_tui.py
```

Full TUI documentation can be found [here](../../config-guide/jans-tui/README.md)

## Uninstall

1. Delete files installed by Janssen

Use the command below to uninstall the Janssen server

```
