arguments, or you would prefer to use a properties file instead of
interactive mode.

```
sudo /opt/jans/jans-cli/jans_cli_tui.py

Full TUI documentation can be found [here](../../config-guide/config-tools/jans-tui/README.md)

If you have selected casa during installation you can access casa using url ```https://<host>/jans-casa```
