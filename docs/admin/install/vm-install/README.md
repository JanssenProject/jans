# Overview

Installing the Janssen software on a VM is a three step process:
1. Check: VM requirements
1. Install: package or docker container
1. Run: `setup.py` to configure

After this process, you should have the Janssen Project software running,
and you'll be ready to start registering OAUTH clients, customizing
your login pages, and doing all the other stuff that Janssen enables.

You can check Github for the latest [Releases](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases). The instructions for the various packages also give you a shortcut
using `wget` and `curl` to get the latest bits for your distro.

Use the left navigation to get started and pick the Janssen Project VM flavor
of your choice!
