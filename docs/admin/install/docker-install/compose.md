## How to run

Download the compose file:

```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/jans-mysql-compose.yml 
```

This docker compose file runs two containers, the janssen monolith container and mysql container.

```bash
docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml up -d
```

To view the containers running:

```bash

docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml ps
```

## Configure Janssen Server

1. Access the Docker container shell using:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml exec jans sh
    ```

2. Grab a pair of client_id and client_pw(secret) from `setup.properties` or `/opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.properties.last`

3. Use the CLI tools located under `/opt/jans/jans-cli/` to configure Janssen Server as needed. For example you can run the [TUI](../../config-guide/config-tools/jans-tui/README.md):
    ```bash
    python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli-tui.py
    ```


## Access endpoints externally

Add to your `/etc/hosts` file the ip domain record which should be the ip of the instance docker is installed at and the domain used in the env above `CN_HOSTNAME`.

```bash
# For-example
172.22.0.3      demoexample.jans.io
```

After adding the record you can hit endpoints such as https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/openid-configuration

## Clean up

Remove setup and volumes

```
docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml down
```
