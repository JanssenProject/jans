## How to run

Download the compose file 

```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/jans-mysql-compose.yml 
```

This docker compose file runs two containers, the janssen monolith container and mysql container.

```bash
docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml up -d
```

To view the containers running

```bash

docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml ps
```

## Configure Janssen Server

```bash

docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml exec jans sh #This opens a bash terminal in the running container

/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py #configure using the config-cli

/opt/jans/jans-cli/scim-cli.py #configure using the scim-cli
```

## Access endpoints externally

Add to your `/etc/hosts` file the ip domain record which should be the ip of the instance docker is installed at and the domain used in the env above `CN_HOSTNAME`.

```bash
# For-example
172.22.0.3      demoexample.jans.io
```

After adding the record you can hit endpoints such as https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/openid-configuration

## Clean up

Remove setup and volumes

```
docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml down
```
