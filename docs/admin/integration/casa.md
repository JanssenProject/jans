# Casa - Self-service MFA portal
## Overview

**Casa** is a self-service web portal that allows end users to view, enroll, and remove MFA credentials, including hardware tokens, software tokens, commercial services (like Duo), social login, biometric, and mobile.  Casa is also extensible. As new authentication technologies arise, you can download plugins to leverage them in your organization through Casa

## Prerequisites
- Installed Janssen Server  

## Installing Casa
Casa gets installed as an add-on to Janssen Server and integrates with `jans-auth-server` module as an OpenID connect Relying Party.
Casa can be installed using the command below.  

Currently, Casa installation is supported on CentOS 8 and Ubuntu 20.

The following steps will install Casa as an add-on. 

  - Download installer 
  ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/flex-linux-setup/flex_linux_setup/flex_setup.py  -O flex_setup.py
  ```
  - Run the installer
  ```
    python3 flex_setup.py
  ```
### Automate install

<br/>If you have `setup.properties` file and want to automate installation, you can pass properties file as
    ```
    python3 flex_setup.py -f /path/to/setup.properties -n -c
    ```

    Minimal example setup.properties file:

    ```
    ip=10.146.197.201
    hostname=flex.gluu.org
    orgName=Gluu
    admin_email=flex@gluu.org
    city=Austing
    state=Texas
    countryCode=US
    installLdap=True
    admin_password=MyAdminPassword
    ldapPass=MyLdapPassword
    casa_client_id=3000.7986c837-2a8f-4c31-9c63-1bd2f6abce77
    casa_client_pw=MyCasaClientSecret
    ```
3. You will be prompted: 
`Install Admin UI [Y/n]:`. Select `n`

4. You will be prompted: 
`Install Casa [Y/n]:`. Select `y`

5. At the end of the installation you will be presented with a URL to access the Casa portal. 
6. You can use this URL and log into the portal using the administrator credentials that you created during the Janssen Server installation. 

## Enabling Authentication methods

1. Goto `/opt/jans/jetty/casa` folder and execute `touch .administrable`. [Further reading]()
2. [Enable authentication mechanisms](https://github.com/maduvena/jans-docs/wiki/Enabling-an-authentication-mechanism-(or-custom-script)) in Jan-auth server like `otp`, `fido2`, `email_otp`.
```
python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.py -enable-script="<inum_of_script>"
```
| Inum | displayName |
|---|---|
| 09A0-93D7 | smpp  |
| 5018-D4BF | otp |
| 5018-F9CF | duo |
| 8BAF-80D7 | fido2 |
| 92F0-BF9E | super_gluu |
| 09A0-93D6 | twilio_sms |

When successfully enabled, you should see a confirmation message similar to the one below on console: 

```
Please wait while collecting properties...
Enabling scripts 5018-D4BF
```

3. Login to the Casa portal as an administrator 
4. Enable authentication methods by navigating to `Administration console` -> `Enabled Authentication methods`. Details about enabling authentication methods are available in [Casa documentation](https://gluu.org/docs/casa/4.4/administration/admin-console/#configure-casa)

## Configuring authentication methods

At this point, users ([How to create users](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/docs/admin/jans-cli/cli-user.md#creating-an-user-resources)) can log in to the Casa portal and [enable/configure one or more authentication methods](https://gluu.org/docs/casa/4.4/user-guide/) for their account.
