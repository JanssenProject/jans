# Casa - Self-service MFA portal

## Overview

**Casa** is a self-service web portal that allows end users to view, enroll, and remove MFA credentials, including hardware tokens, software tokens, commercial services (like Duo), social login, biometric, and mobile.  Casa is also extensible. As new authentication technologies arise, you can download plugins to leverage them in your organization through Casa.

## Prerequisites

- Installed Janssen Server  

## Installing Casa

Casa gets installed as an add-on to Janssen Server and integrates with `jans-auth-server` module as an OpenID connect Relying Party.
Casa can be installed using the command below.  

Currently, Casa installation is supported on CentOS 8 and Ubuntu 20.

The following steps will install Casa as an add-on.

- Download installer
  
  ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/flex-linux-setup/flex_linux_setup/flex_setup.py  -O flex_setup.py
  ```
  
- Run the installer

```shell
python3 flex_setup.py
```
  
### Automate install

If you have `setup.properties` file and want to automate installation, you can pass properties file as

```shell
python3 flex_setup.py -f /path/to/setup.properties -n -c
```

Minimal example setup.properties file:

```shell
ip=10.146.197.201
hostname=flex.gluu.org
orgName=Gluu
admin_email=flex@gluu.org
city=Austin

casa_client_id=3000.7986c837-2a8f-4c31-9c63-1bd2f6abce77

```

- You will be prompted:  
`Install Admin UI [Y/n]:`. Select `n`

- You will be prompted:  
`Install Casa [Y/n]:`. Select `y`

- At the end of the installation you will be presented with a URL to access the Casa portal.
