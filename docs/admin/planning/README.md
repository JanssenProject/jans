# Overview

This Deployment Guide will help you to plan how to launch a digital identity
service for your organization. It will hopefully answer many of the "why"
questions, not just the "how" questions, setting the stage for what challenges
are in scope for Janssen--and where you may need to use other software.  It
addresses some common questions that don't quite fit into other parts of the
Janssen docs.

By covering the key features and designs, hopefully, this guide will help you understand the different deployment options available, when to use each, and how
to right-size your Janssen identity services.

The audience for this deployment guide includes technical architects, designers,
developers and Janssen administrators.
