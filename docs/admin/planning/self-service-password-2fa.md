If your domain offers two-factor authentication, it's a good idea to enable end
users to manage their various credentials. Google does a great job in this
regard. Check out [2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
What's great about this page is that Google lets you manage all your different
credentials on one page.

You can build a page like Google on your own website. You need to be able to
list, add, and remove 2FA credentials for a given user's account. But another
good option is the [Jans Casa](https://docs.jans.io/vreplace-janssen-version/casa) web application.
