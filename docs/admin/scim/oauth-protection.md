## oauth-protection
the basic SCIM standard does not define a specific mechanism to prevent unauthorized requests to endpoints
There are just a few guidelines in section 2 of RFC 7644 concerned with authentication and authorization.
Jans Server  supports mechanisms to protect your endpoints:
Standard OAuth tokens is the default and recommended mechanism.

  -Launch jans-tui
  
  -Navigate to SCIM 
  
  -Locate the Scim properties section
  
  -Select OAUTH in the Protection Mode list
  
  -Click the "Save Configuration" button at the bottom
