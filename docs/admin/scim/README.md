# Overview

**S**ystem for **C**ross-domain **I**dentity **M**anagement, in short **SCIM**, is a specification that simplifies the exchange of user identity information across different domains. The Janssen Server provides an implementation for the SCIM specification.

The specification defines reference schemas for users and groups along with REST API to manage them. For more details, refer to the current version of the specification governed by the following documents: [RFC 7642](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642), [RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643), and [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

Developers can think of **SCIM** merely as a **REST API** with endpoints exposing **CRUD** functionality (create, read, update, and delete).

This section covers how to configure, protect, and monitor the Janssen Server SCIM module and its APIs.
