# Quick Start Using Agama Lab

In this quick start guide, we will see how to build, deploy and test a simple password based authentication flow using
Agama and [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab). 

[Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab) is an online visual editor to build these authentication flows. The flow
built on Agama Lab is packaged as a `.gama` project file. `.gama` package needs to be manually deployed on 
Janssen Server where Agama engine will execute the flow when authentication request is received.

Major Steps involved in this process are:
- Designing a flow using Agama labs
- Enable Agama engine on Janssen Server
- Deploying `.gama` on Janssen Server
- Testing the flow

## Prerequisites

- Janssen Server instance
- A public GitHub repository with at least one prior commit
