# 2FA authentication scripts

Jython files contained in the top level of this folder are already added as authentication scripts in your Janssen installation.

Inside `other` directory you may find extra information about these scripts as well as additional (non curated) scripts that you may use as a guide to integrate third party authentication services or APIs with Janssen server.
