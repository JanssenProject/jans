# Person Authentication scripts

The Janssen Server leverages interception scripts of 
[PersonAuthenticationType](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/script/src/main/java/io/jans/model/custom/script/type/auth/PersonAuthenticationType.java) which when implemented can facilitate complex 
multi-step, multi-factor authentication workflows.

The authentication flow in the Janssen Server is driven by the 
[OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html). 
The authorization request to the OP (the Janssen Server) contains an 
optional query parameter called `acr_values` which is used by the OP to pick an 
interception script which will be run when `/authorize` endpoint 
(Authentication flow) is invoked.

Each authentication method, whose name is the `acr` value, 
is tied to a `PersonAuthenticationType` script which offers the authentication
workflow.

Typically, a `PersonAuthenticationType` script can be used to:  

- Introduce a new 2FA authentication mechanism  
- Customize multi-step authentication  
- Offer Social logins  
- Proactively perform fraud detection and block a fraudulent user

Authentication mechanisms offered by Jans can be confirmed by checking the
Janssen Server OP configuration URL:

```
https://<hostname>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

under the claim `acr_values_supported`.

## Building blocks of an authentication workflow

Jans-auth server comprises of a number of beans, configuration files and 
Facelets (JSF) views, packaged as a WAR module. That means custom scripts and 
custom pages (JSF facelets) can make use of business logic already encapsulated 
in the Weld managed beans. 

The following sections explain how authentication 
flow can be built using a custom script.

### A. Custom script
The **PersonAuthenticationType** script is described by a java interface 
whose methods should be overridden to implement an authentication workflow.
The [article](../scripts/person-authentication-interface) talks about these
methods in detail and the psuedo code 
for each method.

### B. UI pages:
All web pages are **xhtml** files. The Command-Action offering by JSF 
framework is used by the Jans-auth server to implement authentication flows.

#### a. Server-side actions implemented by custom script:
The custom script's `authenticate` and `prepareForStep` implementations are 
called by the following java class - [Authenticator](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-auth-server/server/src/main/java/io/jans/as/server/auth/Authenticator.java). These methods are 
mapped as command actions and view actions respectively in the web page.

Relevant methods:

| Signature                             | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| boolean authenticate()                | Makes the authentication flow proceed by calling the `authenticate` method of the custom script   |
| String prepareAuthenticationForStep() | Makes the authentication flow proceed by calling the `prepareForStep` method of the custom script |

#### b. Web page in xhtml:
1. The `f:metadata` and `f:viewAction` tags are used to load variables 
(prepared in the `prepareForStep` method of the custom script). These 
variables are rendered on the UI page.
```
<f:metadata>
   <f:viewAction action="#{authenticator.prepareAuthenticationForStep}"
     if="#{not identity.loggedIn}" />
 </f:metadata>
```
2. A form submit takes the flow to the `authenticate()` method of the custom script.
```
<h:commandButton id="updateButton" value="Update"
               styleClass="btn btn-primary col-sm-4"
               action="#{authenticator.authenticate}" style="margin:5px;" />
```

#### c. Page customizations:
The Jans-auth server comes with a default set of pages for login, logout, 
errors, authorizations. You can easily override these pages or write new ones. 
You can easily apply your own stylesheet, images and resouce-bundles to your 
pages.

This [article](#c-page-customizations) covers all the details you need to write your own web page.

### C. Business logic in Custom script:  
Jans-auth server uses Weld 3.0 (JSR-365 aka CDI 2.0) for managed beans. 
The most important aspects of business logic are implemented through a set of 
beans. Details and examples of this can be found in this [article](../managed-beans.md)

### D. Third party libraries for use in the custom script
Java or Python libraries to be imported and used very easily. Remember, you 
can import a python library only if it has been written in "pure python".
More details of this mentioned [here](../interception-scripts.md#using-python-libraries-in-a-script)

### E. Configuring the `acr` parameter in the Jans-auth server:

The `acr` parameter can be configured in the following ways :

####  Default authentication method:

`default_acr`: This is the default authentication mechanism exposed to all 
applications that send users to the Janssen Server for sign-in. Unless an app 
specifically requests a different form of authentication using the 
OpenID Connect acr_values parameter (as specified below), users will receive 
the form of authentication specified in this field.

#### Internal ACR

If a default ACR is not specified, Janssen will determine it based on enabled 
scripts and the internal user/password ACR. This internal ACR, 
`simple_password_auth`, is set to level -1. This means that it has lower 
priority than any scripts, so Janssen server will use it only if no other 
authentication method is set.

Use the jans-cli to [update / look-up the default authentication method](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-cli/edit/main/docs/cli/cli-default-authentication-method.md).

#### Authentication method for a client (RP):
A client may also specify `default_acr_values` during registration 
(and omit the parameter `acr_values` while making an authentication request).

#### Multiple Authentication Mechanisms
The Jans Server can concurrently support multiple authentication mechanisms, 
enabling Web and mobile apps (clients) to request a specific type of 
authentication using the standard OpenID Connect request parameter: `acr_values`.
Learn more about acr_values in the [OpenID Connect core spec](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#acrSemantics).

#### Enabling an authentication mechanism
An Authentication method is offered by the AS if its ACR value i.e. its 
corresponding custom script is `enabled`.

By default, users will get the default authentication mechanism as 
specified above. However, **using the OpenID Connect acr_values parameter, 
web and mobile clients can request any enabled authentication mechanism**.

1. Obtain the json contents of a custom script by using a jans-cli command like `get-config-scripts-by-type`, `get-config-scripts-by-inum` etc.
	Example :
	 - `/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-type --url-suffix type:PERSON_AUTHENTICATION`
	 - `/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-config-scripts-by-inum --url-suffix inum:6122281b-b55d-4dd0-8115-b098eeeee2b7`

2. [Update the custom script](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/cli-custom-scripts.md#update-an-existing-custom-script) and change the `enabled` attribute to `true`  

#### Level (rank) of an Authentication mechanism :
Each authentication mechanism (script) has a "Level" assigned to it which 
describes how secure and reliable it is. **The higher the "Level", higher is 
the reliability represented by the script.** Though several mechanisms can be 
enabled at the same Janssen server instance at the same time, for any specific 
user's session only one of them can be set as the current one (and will be 
returned as `acr` claim of id_token for them). If after initial session is 
created a new authorization request from a RP comes in specifying another 
authentication method, its "Level" will be compared to that of the method 
currently associated with this session. If requested method's "Level" is 
lower or equal to it, nothing is changed and the usual SSO behavior is observed.
If it's higher (i.e. a more secure method is requested), it's not possible to 
serve such request using the existing session's context, and user must 
re-authenticate themselves to continue. If they succeed, a new session 
becomes associated with that requested mechanism instead.

### F. Using person authenticator `jansAuthenticator` attribute :

The `jansAuthenticator` attribute can be used in cases when person authenticator
need to persist data between person logins. For example script can have 
enrollment and authentication flows. And after enrollment it needs to store 
data into user entry for later use in authentication flow.
In order to search by enrolled authenticator there is another multi-valued 
attribute `jansExtUid`. This attribute has default DB index to quick search.
Both attributes is recommended to use In Jans since 1.1.1 version for better 
compatibility in future.


#### 1. Format of attributes

```
jansExtUid: [otp:xyz1, cert:xyz2, duo:xyz3, ...]
jansAuthenticator: {
   "xyz1": {"id": "xyz1", "type": "otp", "custom": {...}}, 
   "xyz2": {"id": "xyz2", "type": "cert", "custom": {...}},
   "xyz3": {"id": "xyz3", "type": "duo", "custom": {...}},
    ...
}

```

#### 2. Sample data:

```
jansExtUid: [hotp:S9dO_qKQoOcpPk9GuStlNO9seoA=, cert:totp, duo:Nv7Dg7aP0wRPJd6NHjx1ai9bN9Y=]
jansAuthenticator:
{
  "S9dO_qKQoOcpPk9GuStlNO9seoA=": {
    "id": "S9dO_qKQoOcpPk9GuStlNO9seoA=",
    "type": "hotp",
    "custom": {
      "movingFactor": 3
    }
  },
  "Nv7Dg7aP0wRPJd6NHjx1ai9bN9Y=": {
    "id": "Nv7Dg7aP0wRPJd6NHjx1ai9bN9Y=",
    "type": "totp"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Access `jansAuthenticator` and `jansExtUid` from generic bean

For both attributes there are get/set methods in `User` entry. After loading 
user object script can call these methods to get required data.

```
...
    @AttributeName(name = "jansExtUid")
    private String[] externalUid;

    @JsonObject
    @AttributeName(name = "jansAuthenticator")
    private UserAuthenticatorList authenticator
...
	public String[] getExternalUid() {
		return externalUid;
	}

	public void setExternalUid(String[] externalUid) {
		this.externalUid = externalUid;
	}

	public UserAuthenticatorList getAuthenticator() {
		return authenticator;
	}

	public void setAuthenticator(UserAuthenticatorList authenticator) {
		this.authenticator = authenticator;
	}
...
```

`UserAuthenticatorList` is defined [here](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/model/src/main/java/io/jans/model/user/authenticator/UserAuthenticatorList.java). It contains list
of `UserAuthenticator` objects. `UserAuthenticator` is defined [here](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/model/src/main/java/io/jans/model/user/authenticator/UserAuthenticator.java)

For convenience in 1.1.1 there is new service `UserAuthenticator`. See it's 
code [here](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/model/src/main/java/io/jans/model/user/authenticator/UserAuthenticator.java)

It provides next API methods:

```
	public UserAuthenticatorList getUserAuthenticatorList(SimpleUser user);

	public List<UserAuthenticator> getUserAuthenticatorsByType(SimpleUser user, String type);

	public UserAuthenticator getUserAuthenticatorById(SimpleUser user, String id);

	public void addUserAuthenticator(SimpleUser user, UserAuthenticator userAuthenticator);

	public void removeUserAuthenticator(SimpleUser user, UserAuthenticator userAuthenticator);

	public void removeUserAuthenticator(SimpleUser user, String type);

	public UserAuthenticator createUserAuthenticator(String id, String type);

	public UserAuthenticator createUserAuthenticator(String id, String type, Map<String, Object> custom);

	public String formatExternalUid(String id, String type);

	public boolean checkAndMigrateToAuthenticatorList(SimpleUser user);
```

All these methods update both `jansAuthenticator` and `jansExtUid` attributes 
without persisting changes to DB. After calling these methods script should 
persist user entry. It's expected behaviour because script might update other 
fields too. Hence it's better to persist all changes in one update request to DB.


#### 1. Default authentication method:

`default_acr`: This is the default authentication mechanism exposed to all 
applications that send users to the Janssen Server for sign-in. Unless an app 
specifically requests a different form of authentication using the 
OpenID Connect acr_values parameter (as specified below), users will receive 
the form of authentication specified in this field.

## Usage scenarios

### A. Implementing 2FA authentication mechanisms
1. [FIDO2](../../../script-catalog/person_authentication/fido2-external-authenticator/README) : Authentications using platform authenticators embedded into a person's device or physical USB, NFC or Bluetooth security keys that are inserted into a USB slot of a computer

2. [OTP authentication](../../../script-catalog/person_authentication/otp-external-authenticator) : Authentication mechanism using an app like [Google authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) or [Authy](https://authy.com/) that implements the open standards [HOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and [TOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)

3. SMS OTP :  

4. Email OTP:


### B. Implementing Multistep authentication
1. [Redirect to previous step](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-linux-setup/jans_setup/static/extension/person_authentication/other/basic.reset_to_step/BasicResetToStepExternalAuthenticator.py): The script here an example of how the 
number of steps can be varied depending on the context or business requirement.

### C. Implementing Social logins
You can use a `PersonAuthenticationType` script to allow users to sign using 
credentials from popular **Social Identity providers** or 
**Inbound Identity Providers** like Facebook, Google and Apple. After users 
authenticate, thier Social Identity Provider credentials are provisioned into 
the Jans-auth server. More on this topic in this [article](../../recipes/social-login.md)

### D. Proactively perform fraud detection
1. Impossible travel

## Testing an authentication flow

An example of a complete URL looks like this -
		```

		https://<your.jans.server>/jans-auth/authorize.htm? \
		response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://<your.jans.server>/admin \
		&client_id=17b8b82e-b3ec-42a2-bd90-097028a37f3 \
		&scope=openid+profile+email+user_name \
		&state=faad2cdjfdddjfkdf&nonce=dajdffdfsdcfff
	```
To test , enter the complete URL for authorization in a browser or create a 
simple webmapage with a link that simulates the user sign-in attempt. If the 
server is configured properly, the first page for the selected authentication 
method will be displayed to the user.

## FAQs

### 1. How can error messages be displayed on a web page?
1. FacesMessage bean is used for this purpose.
	```
	from org.jans.jsf2.message import FacesMessages
	from org.jans.service.cdi.util import CdiUtil
	from javax.faces.application import FacesMessage
	...

	facesMessages = CdiUtil.bean(FacesMessages)
	facesMessages.setKeepMessages()
	facesMessages.add(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR, "Please enter a valid username")

	```
2. The error will appear in the associated template using the following markup:
	```
	...
	<h:messages />
	...
	```
	See an example [here](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/685a1593fb53e2310cfa38fcd49db94f3453042f/jans-auth-server/server/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/incl/layout/template.xhtml#L41)

### 2. How is redirection to a third party application for authentication handled in a script?

For user authentication or consent gathering, there might be a need to redirect to a third party application to perform some operation and return the control back to authentication steps of the custom script. Please apply these steps to a person authentication script in such a scenario:

 - Return from def getPageForStep(self, step, context), a page /auth/method_name/redirect.html ; with content similar to the code snippet below -
	```
    def getPageForStep(self, step, context):
        return "/auth/method_name/redirect.html"
	```
 - Contents of redirect.xhtml should take the flow to prepareForStep method
	```
	...
	    <f:metadata>
	        <f:viewAction action="#{authenticator.prepareForStep}" if="#{not identity.loggedIn}" />
	    </f:metadata>
	```
 - In method prepareForStep prepare data needed for redirect and perform the redirection to the external service.
	```
	def prepareForStep(self, step, context):
	        .....
	    facesService = CdiUtil.bean(FacesService)
	    facesService.redirectToExternalURL(third_party_URL )

	    return True
	```
 - In order to resume flow after the redirection, invoke a similar URL to https://my.gluu.server/postlogin.htm?param=123 from the third party app which takes the flow back to the authenticate method of the custom script.
So create an xhtml page postlogin.xhtml which will look like this :
	```
	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
	      xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core">

	<f:view transient="true" contentType="text/html">
	    <f:metadata>
	        <f:viewAction action="#{authenticator.authenticateWithOutcome}" />
	    </f:metadata>
	</f:view>

	</html>
	```
The `<f:viewAction action="#{authenticator.authenticateWithOutcome}" />` in step 4 takes us to the authenticate method inside the custom script `def authenticate(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters, step):`. Here you can
 - use parameters from request
	```
	param = ServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, "param-name"))
	```
 - perform the `state` check (state : Opaque value used to maintain state between the request and the callback.)

 - finally, return true or false from this method.
