# WWPass integration for Gluu

[WWPass](https://wwpass.com/) replaces the traditional username and password
login with a more advanced multi-factor authentication solution. WWPass employs
strong cryptography and robust combination of authentication factors to deliver
a secure and user-friendly authentication experience. WWPass authentication
starts with a smartphone app or a hardware token as the first authentication
factor. Then additional authentication factors such as PIN or biometrics can be
added to verify the user identity further.

## Installation
