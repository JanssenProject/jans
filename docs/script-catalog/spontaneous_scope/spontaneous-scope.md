## Interface
The Spontaneous scope script implements the [SpontaneousScopeType](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/script/src/main/java/io/jans/model/custom/script/type/spontaneous/SpontaneousScopeType.java) interface. This extends methods from the base script type in addition to adding new methods:

### Inherited Methods

| Method header | Method description |
|:-----|:------|
| `def init(self, customScript, configurationAttributes)` | This method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc |
| `def destroy(self, configurationAttributes)` | This method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the `init()` method |
| `def getApiVersion(self, configurationAttributes, customScript)` | The getApiVersion method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Only include the customScript variable if the value for getApiVersion is greater than 10 |

### New Methods

| Method header | Method description |
|:-----|:------|
| `def manipulateScopes(self, context)` | This method is called before spontaneous scope is persisted. It's possible to disable persistence via `context.setAllowSpontaneousScopePersistence(false)` Also it's possible to manipulated already granted scopes, e.g. `context.getGrantedScopes().remove("transaction:456")` |


### Objects
| Object name | Object description |
|:-----|:------|
|`customScript`| The custom script object. [Reference](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-core/script/src/main/java/io/jans/model/custom/script/model/CustomScript.java) |
|`configurationAttributes`| `configurationProperties` passed in when adding custom script. `Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty> configurationAttributes` |
|`context`| Execution Context [Reference](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/blob/main/jans-auth-server/server/src/main/java/io/jans/as/server/model/common/ExecutionContext.java) |
