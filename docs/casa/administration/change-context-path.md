# Change Application Context Path

To publish the application at a location other than `/casa`, do the following:

1. Log into Janssen Server using SSH       
      
1. Edit tag `<Set name="contextPath">` in file 
   `/opt/jans/jetty/jans-casa/webapps/jans-casa.xml` with the new path you want 
   to use. For example, if you chose `/creds`, you would do the following:    
   
    ```  
      <Set name="contextPath">/creds</Set>     
    ```  

1. Edit tag `<Set name="contextPath">` in file 
   `/opt/jans/jetty/jans-casa/webapps/jans-casa_web_resources.xml` 
   appropriately with the new path you want to use.
    
1. Adjust Apache's .conf file:    

    - Locate the `https_jans.conf` file. The exact location will vary depending on your distribution. In Ubuntu, for example, you can find it at `/etc/apache2/sites-available`
   
    - Find the section starting with `<Location /casa>` and replace the 2 occurrences of `casa` with the path of your choice. Do not use trailing slashes   

    - Add the following directive: `Redirect /casa /<new-context-path>` before all `<Location>` and `<Proxy>` sections

1. Adjust custom script settings: adjust the "supergluu_app_id" property of the `casa` custom script accordingly

1. Wait for around 1 minute (so the server picks the script changes), then restart Casa and Apache services. Use this [page](../../admin/vm-ops/restarting-services.md) as a guide

1. The application should be accessible now at the new URL.
