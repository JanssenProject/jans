2. **Feature Freeze**: The release manager announces the feature freeze date. After this date, no new features will be added to the release. The team focuses on fixing bugs and improving the quality of the release. QA starts testing the release.

4. **Release Candidate**: The release manager creates a release candidate and shares it with the team for testing. The team tests the release candidate and reports any issues found. The release manager fixes the issues and creates a new release candidate. This process continues until the release candidate is stable. This normally done via a PR process and release branch following the structure `release-<version>`.
5. **Release**: The release manager creates the final release and shares it with the team. The team tests the final release and reports any issues found. The release manager fixes the issues and creates a new release. This process continues until the final release is stable.
