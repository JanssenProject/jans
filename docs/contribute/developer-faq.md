## How to enable debug logs for jans-cli and TUI configuration tools

By default, logging is not enabled for CLI or TUI tools on Janssen Server. Follow the steps below
to enable and configure logging for CLI and TUI tools:

- Log in as root user
- open config file for editing `~/.config/jans-cli.ini`
- Update value for `debug` to `true` and add new entry for `log_dir` key with value pointing to directory where logs need to be generated. e.g 
  ```
  debug = true
  log_dir = /opt/jans
  ```
- Close currently open TUI session if any and open a new one
- Logs should get available at location configured in `log_dir` in files `cli_debug.log` and `dev-tui.log`

## How to get certificate from Let's encrypt

 `Let's Encrypt` is a CA that provides free CA certificates. You can use these
certificates to enable HTTPS communication with Janssen Server. Refer to this
 [guide](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) from Let's Encrypt to know
more. We have compiled a set of commands for different OS platforms to help
you as a quick reference to generate Let's Encrypt CA certificates.

### Suse

```bash
sudo zypper -n install certbot
```

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /srv/www/htdocs -d FQDN
```

### Ubuntu

```bash 
sudo apt update && sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```
```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d FQDN
```

To check certbot status
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

To renew certificate run
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

### RHEL

```bash
sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```
```bash
sudo certbot certonly --apache
```
