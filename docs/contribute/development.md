# Developing for Janssen Project

## Remote Debugging

Janssen Server modules run as Java processes. Hence, like any other Java process the JVM running the module
can be configured to open a debug port where a remote debugger can be attached. The steps below will show how to
configure `auth-server` module for remote debugging.

1. Pass the command-line options to the JVM

   On the Janssen Server host, open the service config file `/etc/default/jans-auth` and add the following JVM
   parameters to as `JAVA_OPTIONS`
    ```
    -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=6001
    ```
   This will open the port `6001` for the remote debugger. Any other port can also be used based on availability.

2. Restart `jans-auth` services
    ```
    systemctl restart jans-auth.service
    ```

3. Check if the port is open and accessible from within the Janssen Server host
   Use the `jdb` tool from JDK to test if the JVM port has been opened
   ```
   ./<path-to-JDK>/bin/jdb -attach 6001
   ```
   if the port is open, it'll give you output like the below:
   ```
   Set uncaught java.lang.Throwable
   Set deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable
   Initializing jdb ...
   >
   ```
   press `ctrl+c` to come out of it.

4. Ensure that the port is accessible from outside the host VM as well and firewalls are configured accordingly

5. Connect to the remote port on the Janssen Server host from the developer workstation. Use any IDE (Intellij, Eclipse,
   etc.) to create and run a remote debugging profile. Provide IP and debug port of the Janssen Server host.

   For IntelliJIdea, create a debug configuration as below:

## Run Integration Tests with a Janssen Server VM

In this guide, we will look at steps to run the Janssen integration test suite against an installed Janssen
Server.

### Component Setup

Instructions in this guide can be used if Janssen Server is installed on a VM. Either locally on the developer workstation
itself(as shown below) or on a remote cloud VM.

### Install Janssen Server

Install the Janssen server using one of the methods described in the installation guide. Note the points below when
following installation instructions.

- Make a note
  of the `host name` that you assign to the Janssen server during the installation. For this guide, the Janssen hostname
  would be `janssen2.op.io`
- Choose to install with test data load. This can be achieved by using `-t` switch when invoking the setup script
  from installation instructions.

Use the [VM installation guide](../admin/install/vm-install/README.md) for a complete set of instructions.

Once the installation is complete, check if the `.well-known` end-points of the
Janssen server from the browser. A successful response will ascertain that the
The Janssen server running inside local VM is healthy and also accessible from the developer's machine.

!!! Note
Based on developer setup it may be necessary to add appropriate IP-HOST mapping to the developer workstation. For
instance, on a Linux-based developer workstation, this means adding a mapping to `/etc/hosts` file. Make sure that
VM's IP is mapped to a FQDN like `janssen2.op.io`. Refering to VM with `localhost` or just IP will not work.

URI for OpenID configuration `.well-known` endpoint:

  ```
  https://janssen2.op.io/jans-auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ```

The response received should be JSON formatted Janssen configuration details, similar to those below.

  ```
  {
  "request_parameter_supported" : true,
  "pushed_authorization_request_endpoint" : "https://janssen2.op.io/jans-auth/restv1/par",
  "introspection_endpoint" : "https://janssen2.op.io/jans-auth/restv1/introspection",

  }, {
    "https://jans.io/scim/all-resources.search" : [ ]

    "https://jans.io/scim/fido.read" : [ ]
  }, {
    "https://jans.io/scim/fido2.write" : [ ]
    
  ```

### Setup The Certificates

To run the tests against the installed Janssen Server, the workstation JRE needs to have the appropriate
certificate installed. Update cacerts using the steps below:


- extract certificate for Janssen server with name `janssen2.op.io`
  ```
  openssl s_client -connect test.local.jans.io:443 2>&1 |sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > /tmp/httpd.crt
  ```
  this command takes a few seconds to return.

- Update cacerts of your JRE which is being used by the code workspace. For example,  
  `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto`. When running the command below, it will prompt for cert store password. Provide
  the correct password. The default password is `changeit`.
  ```
  keytool -import -alias janssen2.op.io -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto/lib/security/cacerts -file /tmp/httpd.crt
  ``` 

### Configure developer workspace

Now that we have Janssen Server running in a VM and it is accessible from the developer workstation as well, we will
create and configure the code base on the developer workspace to run integration tests.

Get Janssen server code from [Janssen GitHub repository](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans).

Janssen Server is composed of multiple modules. Each module has its own set of tests.
Below are the instructions for configuring each module for tests.

#### Configuring the server and the client modules

##### Profile setup

Many Janssen Server modules and sub-modules use test configuration stored in a directory named `profile`. The profile
directory contains files that hold important information required to run tests. Developers can create one or more
profiles and use them to run tests against different Janssen Servers.

Since Janssen Server has been installed with test data, the installer also created the profile files required to run
the test.
These files are kept on the VM under `/opt/jans/jans-setup/output/test/jans-auth` directory. Copy over this directory to
any location on the developer workstation.

Follow the steps below to configure the profile for the client module. The same steps should be followed for
setting up a profile for the server module.

1. Under `jans-auth-server/client/profile` module, create a new directory and name it as `janssen2.op.io`
2. Copy the contents of `jans-auth/client` directory into the newly created `janssen2.op.io` directory
3. Copy keystore file `/client/profiles/default/client_keystore.p12` from `default` directory to
   the `janssen2.op.io` directory

#### Configuring the Agama Module

Agama module code resides under `jans/agama` directory.

Follow the steps below from `agama` directory to configure the module to run the integration tests.

1. Remove existing profile if any by deleting and recreating the directory `engine/profiles/janssen2.op.io`
2. Copy the file `jans-auth/config-agama-test.properties` to the `engine/profiles/janssen2.op.io/` directory

Once the above steps have been followed, the local copy of `jans-auth` directory that was copied
from `janssen2.op.io` can be deleted.

### Running The Tests

Each module in Janssen Server has its tests that have to be executed separately.
For example, to run integration tests for `jans-auth-server` module, run the following maven command at the directory
level:

  ```
  mvn -Dcfg=janssen2.op.io test
  ```
