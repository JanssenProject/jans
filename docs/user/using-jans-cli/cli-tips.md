# Tips (CLI)

In this section, We have discussed on some basic information about Janssen CLI method so that anyone get some idea to use this method easily. 

## Basic Argument

1. `-h` or `--help` to get all the formations of command line argument (ex; `/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py -h`)
2. `--info` to get formations about some operations id for a specific task (ex; `opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --info User`)
3. `--operation-id` usage to operate each of the sub-task
4. `--endpoint-args` advanced usage for operation-id
5. `--data` usage to share data in operations


## Patch Request (schema)

This schema file can be found in `/components/schemas/PatchRequest` for those which one support this operation.

When you examine this sample schema, you will see three properties in an object: op, path, and value.

* __op__: operation to be done, one of `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, `test`
* __path__: Path of the property to be changed. use path separator `/` for config or `.` for SCIM to change a property inside an object.
* __value__: New value to be assigned for each property defined in `path`

## Multiple Patch Request (schema)

When we need to perform multiple patch operations on any configuration endpoint, Instead of doing one by one, we can create a json file including all individual operation into an array. To clarify, please see below json file:


```
[
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "Value"
    },
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    },
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    }
    ...
    ...
    ...
    {
        "op": "operation-name",
        "path": "configuration-path",
        "value": "value"
    }
]
```

This file contains multiple individual patch operation. In [Patch Request (schema)](cli-tips.md#patch-request-schema) we explained about each of these keys in the above json file.

After creating the json file, just run the patch operation command.

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id [patch operation id name] --data [json file absolute url]
```

## Quick Patch Operations

There is another patch request feature. It is a single line patch-request command line. It supports three types of operations:

- `patch-replace`: to replace value with new one.
- `patch-add`: it will add value into the key path.
- `patch-remove`: to remove value from any key path.

The command line looks like below:

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id [patch-operation-id] --[patch-operation-name] key:value
```

for example: 

```
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id patch-config-cache --patch-replace memcachedConfiguration/bufferSize:32788
```

In this command line: 
- `patch-config-cache` is a operation-id from *Cache Configurations* task.
- `patch-replace` type of operation; used to replace values in
- `memcachedConfiguration/bufferSize:32788` is a `key:value` pair
