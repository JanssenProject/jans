# Janssen Triage Process and labels

Triage process is used to quickly screen and categorise new issues and PRs. Aim is to determine characteristics of new PRs/issues and take quick actions if possible. 

Triage process is a contineous process. As new issues/PRs come in, the community initiates discussions, add labels, ask for more details. This process does not wait for triage call or a meeting to be called. <br/><br/>Community holds triage calls at a regular cadence. Triage calls are mainly utilised to discuss issue/PR where concensus is not yet reached and to pick up anything which is not yet triaged. It is encouraged to complete triage outside of triage call to improve velocity. 

### Stages in triage process:

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Needs triage     | When a new issue or PR is created, it is automatically <br/>labeled as `needs-triage`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ready for triage | For all issues/PRs with `needs-triage` label, Maintainers/committers<br/> will assign a suitable active community member as owner to <br/>start evaluating issue/PR . Owner and community will evaluate <br/>merit and characteristics of issue/PR asynchronously and assign approapriate [labels](#labels). <br/>When owner believes that sufficient details have been added <br/>and there is concensus, the owner would remove <br/>`needs-triage` label and apply label `ready-for-triage`. |
| Triaged          | All issues/PRs with label `ready-for-triage` will <br/>be reviewed by core members of the community who have<br/> permission to add `triaged` label. Reviewer reviews <br/>issue/PR to check if the issue/PR is fully triaged and can <br/>be added to backlog without discussion on triage call. <br/>At this point, label `triaged` is added and label <br/>`ready-for-triage` is removed.                                                                                                    |

We expect most of the isseus and PRs will be able to follow above path and quickly move out of triage process without waiting for triage call. Issues/PRs which still doesn't have `triaged` label, or has `needs-discussion` label, will be discussed during triage call.


## Labels

Github labels help us annotate issues/PRs with additional data. Janssen community uses labels, as detailed below, to communicate information and help making decisions about issues/PRs.

### Communication labels

These labels communicate status of current triage process for an issue/PR or indicate where community contribution is required. Most of communication labels would be replaced by other labels as triage process progresses and issue enters active development. For example, `help wanted` label would be removed once issue gets under active development and a community members takes ownership of the issue. Below is the list of labels which fall under this category:

| Label               | Indicates That                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `needs-triage`      | issue/PR needs triaging                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `ready-for-triage`  | that sufficient details has been added to <br/>the issue/PR in form of labels and is ready for triage review                                                                                  |
| `triaged`           | Issue/PR is fully triaged                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `needs-information` | Indicates that creator needs to add more information <br/>to issue/PR in order to be meaningfully triaged. When adding this label, also comment on the issue about what information is needed |
| `needs-discussion`  | Indicates that issue needs discussion during triage meeting. When adding this label, also comment on the issue about what is it that demands discussion on this issue                         |
| `good first issue`  | Indicates to the community that this issue suitable for first time contributor                                                                                                                |
| `help wanted`       | Indicates to the community that this issue has complexity <br/>which is suitable for contribution from any external contributor                                                               |

### Metadata labels

These labels enrich issue/PR with metadata that will help during triage process and active development. These labels may not be removed from issue/PR, though value of labels may change as development progresses. For example, `effort` label may change from `effort-3` to `effort-8` as we understand issue in more detail. Below is the list of labels in this category:

| Label               | Indicates That                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Details                                                                                |

| `comp-<module>`     | The bot will detect from the title the component between the parentheses. `feat(jans-auth-server): detect` will result in the label `comp-jans-auth-server` added to the issue or PR. In a PR these labels are also detected by modified files path  |
| `area-<concern>`    | The bot will detect from the title the area appropriate. `ci: adding something new to our ci` will result in the label `area-CI` added to the issue or PR. In a PR these labels are also detected by modified files path.                            |
