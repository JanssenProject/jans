# Python for Cedarling

Cedarling provides a binding for Python programs via the [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) library. This allows Python developers to use the cedarling crate in their code directly. 

## Requirements

- Rust 1.63 or greater
- CPython 3.10 or greater
- For linux systems, installing `build-essential` using your distribution's package manager is recommended

## Building 

The recommended way to include cedarling in a Python project is to compile it to a python wheel via [Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). Follow these steps to compile the wheel:

- Install `maturin` in an isolated environment. Using `venv` is recommended
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install maturin
  ```
  - For linux, install `maturin[patchelf]` instead to get the necessary dependencies
- Clone the [jans](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans) repository and change your working directory to that location
- Navigate to `jans-cedarling/bindings/cedarling_python`
- Compile the binding:
  ```
  maturin build --release
  ```
- The wheel will be available in `target/wheels/`

## Including in projects

If you are developing a simple project in a `venv` setup, in the previous section you can run `maturin develop --release` and maturin will install the wheel into the currently activated virtual environment. After that, you may run your code directly from the command line.

In case of more complicated projects with a dependency manager such as [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can either install the wheel via the command line:
```
poetry add path/to/wheel.whl
```
or include it as a static dependency in the [dependencies](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#dependencies-and-dependency-groups) section of your `pyproject.toml`:
```
...
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
cedarling_python = {path = "path/to/wheel.whl"}
```

For other dependency managers, please check their documentation on how to include static wheels in a project.

## Usage

Once the wheel is included in your project, you may use classes from the `cedarling_python` module in your code, which acts as a Python wrapper around cedarling's functions. See the [usage](./usage.md) document for details.
