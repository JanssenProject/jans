### 2. Initial Configuration

Set up your identity platform with the configuration tools.

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/jans/bin/jans-tui.py
    ```

=== "Command Line"

    ```bash

    ```

=== "Terraform"

    ```hcl
    resource "jans_client" "example" {
      client_name     = "My Application"
      grant_types     = ["authorization_code"]
      redirect_uris   = ["https://myapp.com/callback"]
      response_types  = ["code"]
      scope           = "openid profile email"
    }
    ```

### 3. Create Your First Client

Register an application using Terraform for infrastructure as code.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    jans = {
      source = "JanssenProject/jans"
    }
  }
}

provider "jans" {
  url = "https://your-domain"
}

resource "jans_client" "webapp" {
  client_name    = "Web Application"
  grant_types    = ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]
  redirect_uris  = ["https://myapp.com/callback"]
  response_types = ["code"]
  scope         = "openid profile email"
}
```

### 4. Test Authentication

Verify your setup with a simple authentication flow.

```bash
https://your-domain/jans-auth/restv1/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=openid profile
