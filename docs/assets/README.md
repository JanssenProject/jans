Use the [assets](../assets) directory to store digital assets like images and diagrams that are used to support documentation for all modules. 

## Directory Structure
`logo`: This directory holds logo files used for official documentation and publications. Do not change these files without consulting the CODEOWNER. 

## Guidelines
- Name the file using 4 to 5 keywords (separated by dash `-`) which describes content of the file i.e `diagram-user-registration-sequence.pdf`
- Max file size 1MB each
- images format preferably `.png`
- diagrams format preferably `.svg`
- Preferred diagramming tool: `draw.io`. Upload `.drawio` file along with diagram pdf file with same name. This allows future updates to the diagram to keep it updated
