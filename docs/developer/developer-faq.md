## How to enable debug logs for jans-cli and TUI configuration tools

By default, logging is not enabled for CLI or TUI tools on Janssen Server. Follow the steps below
to enable and configure logging for CLI and TUI tools:

- Log in as root user
- open config file for editing `~/.config/jans-cli.ini`
- Update value for `debug` to `true` and add new entry for `log_dir` key with value pointing to directory where logs need to be generated. e.g 
  ```
  debug = true
  log_dir = /opt/jans
  ```
- Close currently open TUI session if any and open a new one
- Logs should get available at location configured in `log_dir` in files `cli_debug.log` and `dev-tui.log`
