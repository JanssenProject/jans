# User Claims

Claim is a piece of information asserted about an Entity. User claims refer to pieces of information about the authenticated user, such as their name, email address, date of birth, and more. These claims provide the RP with specific attributes or characteristics associated with the user. The claims are issued by the IDP after successful authentication and are included in the ID Token (which is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains user-related information) and are also available through the
`/userinfo` endpoint. 

!!! Note
    `Attribute` and `User Claims` refer to the same user data fields in 
    the Janssen Server.

## Types of User Claims

### Standard Claims 

The Janssen Server includes all standard claims defined in [OpenID Connect specifications](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). Built-in claims defines a standard set of pre-defined claims available to use after installation for sharing of user attributes between identity providers and relying parties.

### Custom Claims

In addition to standard claims, custom claims are also allowed to be defined by the 
Janssen Server. These claims provide flexibility to include application-specific
 user attributes that are not covered by the standard claims. 
 Custom claims can provide additional context or information needed by the RP.

 Refer to [claims configuration document](../../../config-guide/auth-server-config/attribute-configuration.md) for more details on custom claims configuration.
