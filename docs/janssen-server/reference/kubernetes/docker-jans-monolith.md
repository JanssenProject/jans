- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Environment Variables

Installation depends on the set of environment variables shown below. These environment variables can be set to customize installation as per the need. If not set, the installer uses default values.

## How to run

Download the compose file of your chosen persistence from mysql, postgres or ldap 

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/jans-mysql-compose.yml 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/jans-postgres-compose.yml 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/jans-ldap-compose.yml 

```

Download the script files 

```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/up.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/down.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JanssenProject/jans/main/docker-jans-monolith/clean.sh
```

Give execute permission to the scripts
`chmod u+x up.sh down.sh clean.sh`

This docker compose file runs two containers, the janssen monolith container and mysql container.
To start the containers.

```bash
./up.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres|ldap as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```

To view the containers running

```bash

docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml ps
```

To stop the containers.

```bash
./down.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres|ldap as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```

## Configure Janssen Server

1. Access the Docker container shell using:
    ```bash

    docker compose -f jans-mysql-compose.yml exec jans /bin/bash #This opens a bash terminal in the running container
    ```
2. You can grab `client_id` and `client_pw`(secret) pairs and other values from `setup.properties` or `/opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.properties.last`

3. Use the CLI tools located under `/opt/jans/jans-cli/` to configure Gluu flex as needed. For example you can run the [TUI](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/config-guide/config-tools/jans-tui/):
    ```bash
    python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli-tui.py
    ```

## Access endpoints externally

Add to your `/etc/hosts` file the ip domain record which should be the ip of the instance docker is installed at and the domain used in the env above `CN_HOSTNAME`.

```bash
# For-example
172.22.0.3      demoexample.jans.io
```

After adding the record you can hit endpoints such as https://demoexample.jans.io/.well-known/openid-configuration

## Clean up

Remove setup and volumes

```bash
./clean.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres|ldap as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```
