# Janssen System Services

In order to debug issues, checking the Jans services may be necessary. The process to do this differs slightly between operating systems. The following examples are shown on Ubuntu 20.04; however, they should work on any operating system using systemd.

## Getting list of Jans services

```bash
$ sudo systemctl list-units --all "jans*"
UNIT                    LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION               
jans-auth.service       loaded active running Janssen OAauth service    
jans-config-api.service loaded active running Janssen Config API service
jans-fido2.service      loaded active running Janssen Fido2 Service     
jans-scim.service       loaded active running Janssen Scim service      

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

5 loaded units listed.
```
## Other Services

There are more services other than Jans services like Apache. To get the status of those services make sure you use command like

```bash
sudo systemctl list-units --all "apache2*"
```

Note: depending on your OS and the components of Jans installed, the output may be different.

## Checking status of a service
```bash
$ sudo systemctl status jans-auth.service
● jans-auth.service - Janssen OAauth service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/jans-auth.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Tue 2022-11-01 15:03:23 UTC; 1h 38min ago
    Process: 44700 ExecStart=/opt/dist/scripts/jans-auth start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 44727 (java)
      Tasks: 60 (limit: 4677)
     Memory: 889.2M
     CGroup: /system.slice/jans-auth.service
             └─44727 /opt/jre/bin/java -server -Xms256m -Xmx928m -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Djans.base=/etc/jans -Dserver.base=/opt/jans/jetty/jan>
```

In case of an error or a non-functional component, this is where you would find information about the component.
