This guide shows how to upgrade a Janssen VM deployment.

!!! Note
    VM deployments don't provide automatic upgrade/update support. 
    Uninstalling and re-installing with newer binaries is the only option that requires re-configuration of auth-server. 
    Though this is made easy using [Terraform](../terraform/README.md). 
    We recommend using Kubernetes installations over VM, to avail smooth upgrades and better HA support.


Let's assume we are upgrading Jans VM installation from `current version` to `vreplace-janssen-version`

1. Keep the old VM installation running.

2. [Install](../install/vm-install/README.md) on a separate VM the target new Jans installation, i.e. `vreplace-janssen-version`.

    You can install with a test client. For example:

    `sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.py -test-client-id 6382c9da-f25d-435f-ac63-6acde36f4859 -test-client-pw secret1172023`

    This `client-id` and `client-pw` will then be used to import Terraform configurations

3. Use our Terraform [docs](../terraform/README.md) on the new installation, i.e. `vreplace-janssen-version` to:
    - import all the global configurations from the new installation using `terraform import`
    - define all the custom IDP configurations and apply them using `terraform apply`
   
4. At this point there should be two versions up, `old version` and `vreplace-janssen-version`.

5. Traffic should be switched gradually from the old setup to the new setup.
   Once confidence is gained, drain the old VM.
