 }
 ]
}

```

To search using parameters, use the command below:

```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id get-oauth-openid-clients \
--endpoint-args limit:2
```


### Creating a New OpenID Connect Clients

To add an OpenID Connect client, we can use `post-oauth-openid-client` operation id.
As shown in the [output](#using-command-line) for `--info` command, the
`post-oauth-openid-client` operation requires data to be sent
according to `Client` schema.

To see the schema, use the command below:

```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --schema Client
```

The Janssen Server also provides an example of data that adheres to
the above schema. To fetch the example, use the command below.

```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --schema-sample Client
```

Using the schema and the example above, we have added OpenID Connect 
client data to the file `/tmp/openid-connect.json`. An OpenID Connect client may have many properties, but we are going to fill only the required properties as shown below:

```json title="Input" 
{
  "redirectUris": [
    "https://www.google.com/"
 ]
}
```
Now let's post an OpenID Connect client to the Janssen Server to be 
added to the existing set:

```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id post-oauth-openid-client \
--data /tmp/openid-connect.json
```

### Update OpenId Connect client

To update the configuration follow the steps below.

1. [Get the existing OpenID Connect Client](#get-openid-connect-client-by-inum) and store 
it into a file for editing. The following command will retrieve the existing 
OpenID Connect Client in the schema file.
```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py -no-color \
--operation-id get-oauth-openid-clients-by-inum \
--url-suffix inum:1800.ca57f8f8-e163-4cdc-96f2-e2760e627bfe > /tmp/update-client.json
```
2. Edit and update the desired configuration values in the file while keeping
 other properties and values unchanged. Updates must adhere to the `Client`
 schema as mentioned [here](#using-command-line).
3. We have changed in `parLifetime` only the `600` to `700`. Use the updated file 
to send the update to the Janssen Server using the command below
```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --operation-id put-oauth-openid-client \
--data /tmp/update-client.json
```

Upon successful execution of the update, the Janssen Server responds with 
updated configuration


### Patch OpenID Connect Client by inum  

Using `patch-oauth-openid-client-by-inum`, we can modify OpenID Connect Clients 
partially for its properties.

To use this operation, specify the `inum` of the OpenID Connect Client that needs to be updated 
using the `--url-suffix` and the property and the new value using the 
[JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com/#the-patch). Refer [here](../../config-guide/config-tools/jans-cli/README.md#patch-request-schema) 
to know more about schema.

In this example; We will change the value of the property `applicationType` 
from `web` to `native`.

```bash title="Input" linenums="1"
[
{
  "op": "replace",
  "path": "applicationType",
  "value": "native"
}
]
```

Now let's do the operation with the command line.

```bash 
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py \
--operation-id patch-oauth-openid-client-by-inum \
--url-suffix inum:1800.ca57f8f8-e163-4cdc-96f2-e2760e627bfe --data /tmp/schema.json
```

### Get OpenID Connect Client by Inum

With `get-oauth-openid-clients-by-inum` operation-id, we can get any specific 
OpenID Connect Client matched with `Inum`. If we know the `inum`, we can use the 
below command:


```bash 
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py \
--operation-id get-oauth-openid-clients-by-inum \
--url-suffix inum:1800.ca57f8f8-e163-4cdc-96f2-e2760e627bfe
```
The result will only show details of client with 
`inum:1800.ca57f8f8-e163-4cdc-96f2-e2760e627bfe`.


### Delete OpenID Connect client

Delete the OpenID Connect client using its `inum`. The command line is:

```bash title="Command"
/opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py \
--operation-id delete-oauth-openid-client-by-inum \
--url-suffix inum:a89b5c29-2a91-48b5-bf27-1bf786954a06
```
It will delete the OpenID Connect client if it matches with the given `inum`.

## Using Text Based UI

Start TUI using the command below:

```bash title="Command"
jans tui
```

### Client Screen

Navigate to `Auth Server` -> `Clients` to open the client screen as shown
in the image below.

![image](../../../assets/tui-client-screen.png)

* This screen shows the OpenID Connect Clients list. 
* To get the list of currently added clients, bring the control to `Search` box 
(using the tab key), and press the `Enter` key. Type the search string to search 
for the client with the matching client name.


### Add-Update Client screen

* Use the `Add Client` button to create a new client.
* After adding the valid data using the `Save` button, add a new OpenID Connect client.

* Update the OpenID Connect client as well.
* To update the client, bring the control to the Specific `Client` row and press the
`Enter` key, then it will show the edit client screen. 

![image](../../../assets/tui-add-client-screen.png)

### Delete Screen

* To delete the client, bring the control to the Specific `Client` row and press the `Delete` key.
Then it will show the Delete confirmation box.

## Using Configuration REST API

Janssen Server Configuration REST API exposes relevant endpoints for managing
and configuring the OpenID Connect Client. Endpoint details are published in the [Swagger
document](../../reference/openapi.md).
