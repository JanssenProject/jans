# Quick Start Using Agama Lab

In this quick start guide, we will build, deploy and test a simple Agama 
project using the [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab). 
This project will enable user authentication using password when deployed on
an IDP.

Major Steps involved in this process are:

- [Create A New Agama project on the Agama Lab](#create-a-new-agama-project)
- [Defining The Authentication Flow](#defining-the-authentication-flow)
- [Design User Interface](#design-user-interface)
- [Deploy Agama Project](#deploy-agama-project)
- [Test Using Tarp](#testing-using-janssen-tarp)

This guide covers steps above in the following sections.

## Prerequisites

- We will use the [Janssen Server](https://jans.io) to deploy the Agama project.
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.jans.io/head/janssen-server/install/)
to install the Janssen Server.
- You will need a GitHub account where Agama Lab GitHub app has been [integrated](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Sign-Up---Sign-In#need-for-github-account). GitHub
account can be a personal account or an organizational account. For this guide
we will assume that a personal account is being used.
- Two new public GitHub repositories in your GitHub Account. These repositories
will be used as [development repository](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Flow-Designer#development-repository) and [release repository](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Flow-Designer#release-repository). Each repository should have at least one 
commit. A commit that creates a README file is also sufficient.


## Create A New Agama Project

We will use [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab/) to create a simple 
username-password based user authentication project. The will be similar to 
the one shown below.

![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-quick-start-guide.png)

An Agama project may include multiple components. For example, an authentication
flow, a user interface, assets like organization's logo, external libraries, etc. 
In this project, we will see how to  

- Define the authentication steps in for of a flow
- Design the user interface to capture user inputs

Let's get started.

### Log Into Agama Lab


1. Go to [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab) login page. Sign in using
GitHub.

    ![](../../../assets/agama-loginpage.png)

2. Authenticate on the GitHub authentication page.

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-git-login.png)

3. After successful sign in, the [project dashboard](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Agama-Lab-Project-Dashboard)
will be shown. Next step is to select the repository where you want to create 
the project. Select the `development` repository by clicking on 
`Change Repository` -> `Your Repositories` -> select the repository -> `Select`.
   
    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-add-git-repo.png)


4. Project dashboard with all the existing projects(if any) from the GitHub
repository will be shown. New projects can be created, edited, and deleted 
from this project listing page.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-project-page.png)

### Create A New Project

1. To create a new project, click on the `New Project` button.
   Enter the name and the description for the new project and click the `Create` button.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-new-proj.png)

2. This will create a new project.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-project-listing.png)

### Defining The Authentication Flow

1. Create A Flow File

    Open the newly created project by clicking on :material-arrow-top-right:.
    This will open the project in the [project editor](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Project-Editor). 
    
    To start creating the flow, right-click on the `code` directory > `New` > `Flow File`.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-new-flow.png)

    Give name and description for the flow file and then click `Create`.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-new-flow-name.png)

    A newly created flow file contains one `start` block.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-1.png)
    

    In the subsequent steps, we are going to create nodes in the flow using the
    flow editor. Refer to [this](https://github.com/GluuFederation/private/wiki/Project-Editor#working-with-the-flow-editor) guide if you need to understand how 
    to create, delete and configure nodes.

2. Create _AuthenticationService_ Call block

    Drag the colored dot available on the right edge of the `start` node to 
    create the next node in the flow. A list of available node types will be
    presented. 

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-create-call.png)

    Select `Call` node. A new `Call` block should appear with a link to the 
    `Start` block

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-new-call.png)

    Click the `Call` block and then click :material-pencil: to open the 
    configuration screen. Add configuration values as shown below.  
    This configuration will create a new instance of 
    `AuthenticationService` class to 
    authenticate the user. The new instance will be 
    stored in a variable called `authService`.
   
    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-call.png)

3.  Create _CdiUtil_ Call block

    To perform authentication we will also need a bean instance of `CdiUtil` class. It 
    takes `AuthenticationService` instance that we created in the previous step as an input.

    After the `AuthenticationService` create new `Call` node 
   
    _Click on the newly created `Call` block and by clicking :material-pencil: open the configuration page.
    Input values as shown below in the configuration screen_

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-cdiutil.png)

4. Create Assignment block

    Next, we need to create an empty variable that the flow will use in the future to store authentication results. 

    Create an `Assignment` block and configure it as shown below.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-assignment.png)

5. Create Repeat block

    `Repeat` block represents the [Repeat](../../../agama/language-reference.md#repeat) instruction of Agama DSL.

    Repeat block creates a loop to iterate over certain steps(blocks). We will create a repeat loop that allows
    3 retries if the authentication fails.
    
    Create a repeate block after the `Result Object` block 

    ![](../../../assets/agama-create-repeat.png)

    _Click on the newly created `Repeat` block. Click :material-pencil:.
    Input values as shown below in the configuration screen_

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-repeat.png)

6. Create An RRF block

    `RRF` block represents the [RRF](../../../agama/language-reference.md#rrf)
   instruction of Agama DSL.

    Create an RRF block after the `Retry Authentication` block. 
    
    Remember that 
    the `Retry Authentication` is a `Repeat` type of block. It has two possible
    paths. 
    
    - One that originates from the colored dot on the bottom edge will be
    labeled as `repeat`. Execution of the blocks along this path will be
     repeated as configured in the `Repeat` block.
    - Second path originates from the colored dot on the right edge of the 
    `Repeat` block. This path is labeled as `Continue`. These blocks will be 
    executed after `repeate` path completes the execution.

    The new `RRF` block should be created on the `Repeat` path. 

    ![](../../../assets/check-repeat.png)

    Click on the newly created `RRF` block. Click :material-pencil:. Input values as shown below in the configuration
    screen. 

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-rrf.png)
    
    
    With this configuration, the RRF block will 

    - Present an input form to the user. We will build the `login.ftlh` in the [later section](#design-user-interface)
    - Capture and store user inputs like the user-name and password into the
     `creds` variable

    At this stage, let's save the flow using the `Save` button. This creates a new
    commit in your GitHub repository.

7. Create a Call block

    Create a `Call` block to process the username and password received from the user (in RRF) and
    validate them. The result of validation should be stored in a variable.
    
    Create a new call block after the `Login page` block.


    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-create-cdiutil-instance.png)

    Click on the newly created `Call` block. Click :material-pencil:. 
    Configure it as shown below.

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-cdiutil-instance.png)

8. Create An Assignment block

    In case of authentication failure, user will be prompted for reentering the
    credentials on the sign in page. We want to show the username to the user while reentering the
    password on the web page. For this, we will save the username in a variable using the `Assignment` block.

    Create a new assignment block after the `Validate Credentials` block.

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-create-assignment-uid.png)

    Click on the newly created `Call` block. Click :material-pencil:.
    Input values as shown below in the configuration screen

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-assignment-uid.png)

9. Create A Conditional When block

    `When` block represents the [When](../../../agama/language-reference.md#conditionals-and-branching)
   instruction of Agama DSL.

    Create a conditional check using the `When` block to check if the 
    user credentials were successfully validated.

    Create a new `When` block after the `Assignment` block.

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-password-create-when.png)

    _Click on the newly created `When` block. Click :material-pencil:.
    Input values as shown below in the configuration screen_

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-password-edit-when.png)

10. Create [finish]() blocks

     The `Finish` block represents the [Flow finish](../../../agama/language-reference.md#flow-finish) instruction of Agama DSL.

     We will need to create two finish blocks.

     - One finish block to terminate the flow when the authentication is successful.
     - Second finish block to terminate the flow when the authentication is still not successful after 3 repeated attempts.

     If the authentication was successful then the flow should finish and return the
     username. This will be achieved by adding a Finish block to the `Condition met` branch of the `When` block. And if authentication fails after 3
     attempts, we need another `Finish` block following the `Repeat` block.

     Drag and drop colored dot on the lower vertex of the `When` block to create
     a `Condition met` branch. Create a `Finish` block on this branch.

     ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-create-finish.png)

     _Click on the newly created `Finish` block. Click :material-pencil:.
     Input values as shown below in the configuration screen_

     ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-passwd-edit-finish.png)
     
    Let's create a second finish block that will terminate the flow when all 3
    authentication attempts have failed. 
    
    Create a `Finsh` block on the `Continue` branch of the `Repeat` block. 

     ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-create-fail-finish.png)

     _Click on the newly created `Finish` block. Click :material-pencil:.
     Input values as shown below in the configuration screen and click `Save`._

     ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-fail-finish.png)

     Save the flow using the `Save` button on flow canvas.

     The completed flow looks like below:

     ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-quick-start-guide.png)

11. Check Generated code

    Agama Lab flow gets translated in [Agama DSL](../../../agama/language-reference.md). Click the `Code` button to see the code
    generated by the flow.

    ```
    Flow co.acme.password
        Basepath ""
    // Create new  authentication service instance
    authService = Call io.jans.server.service.authenticationService#class 
    // Create new CdiUtil object
    cdiUtil = Call io.jans.service.cdi.uti.CdUtil#bean authService
    // Empty result object 
    authResult = "{}"
    // Retry 3 times to get correct username and password 
    Repeat 3 times max
        // Loads the login page for username and password input 
        creds = RRF "login.ftlh" authResult
        // Validate username and password 
        authResult.success = Call cdiUtil authenticate creds.username creds.password
        // Keep the username in the user needs to retry authentication 
        authResult.uid = "creds.uername"
        When 
              // Return username in case of successful authentication 
              it_oghyk = {success:true, data: { userId: "as9233Qz", property1: "value1"}}
              Finish it_oghyk
        Otherwise
              RRF "__________" 
        Finish __________
    // Max number of failed authentication attempts reached. Return False to end the flow
    Finish false
    ```

### Design User Interface

In the RRF configuration step, we mentioned `login.ftlh` to render the login page elements.
We need to add `login.ftlh` to the Agama project so that the flow can use during the flow execution.
Use the steps below to create the page.

1. Create a template file

    _On the left project explorer menu, click on `web` > `New` > `Freemarker Template`_

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-passwd-create-login-page.png)

    _Select `+ Create` under the `New Blank Template`_

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-select-template.png)

    _Give `Name` and `Description` as shown below and click `Create`_

    ![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-edit-template.png)

2. Use the visual editor

    This opens a visual editor to create an Apache FreeMarker template. 
    Use this visual editor to create a template
    as per the need. For this article, we will use the code below.

    ![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-passwd-edit-template-2.png)

    _Click `Edit HTML`. This opens a text editor. Remove existing code in the editor and paste the code shown below._

    ```html

        </form>
        </div>
      </div>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

_Click `Save changes`_

![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-save-template.png)

_This will render the page in the visual editor_.

![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-render-template.png)

### Release The Project

At this point we have all the components of an Agama project ready and they are 
stored in
the development repository. In order to deploy the project on an IDP, 
We need to build a `.gama` package from these components. We can build a `.gama`
package by releasing the project to the release repository.

_To release the project, click on any of the files in the left project explorer, and click `Release Project`._

![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-release-project.png)

_Enter a desired version number and click `Save`_

![](../../../assets/agamalab-flow-passwd-release-project-gh.png)

Upon successful release, Agama Lab `Releases` dashboard is shown. It lists all projects that are released.

_Click on the project name to go to the GitHub repository release page where `.gama` file has been released_

![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-passwd-release-list.png)

Download the `.gama` file from here to deploy on to the Janssen Server.

![](../../../assets/agama-lab-flow-passwd-release-list-gh.png)

## Deploy Agama Project

1. Download the `.gama` file from the `releases` section of the release repository
   
2. Open Janssen Server [TUI](../../config-guide/config-tools/jans-tui/README.md) 
  and upload the `.gama` package using [these instructions](https://docs.jans.io/head/janssen-server/config-guide/auth-server-config/agama-project-configuration/#agama-project-screen)

3. Ensure that the project has been uploaded without any errors by refreshing
  the project listing after the upload. 

## Testing using Janssen Tarp

We will use the [Jans Tarp](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/tree/main/demos/jans-tarp), 
a browser extension from Janssen Project, 
to test this project. 

- [Install Jans Tarp browser plug-in](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/tree/main/demos/jans-tarp#installation-in-browser)
- Follow [these instructions]() to test using the Janssen Server
- In a successful test run, the browser should prompt user for the user-name and 
  password using the same user-interface that we built in the previous steps.
  ![image](../../../assets/agama-login.png)
- Upon entering a valid user-name and password, the tarp should present a page
  with access token. 
  ![image](../../../assets/successful-tarp-auth-screen.png)
