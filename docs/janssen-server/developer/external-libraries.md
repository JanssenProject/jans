Janssen Server [Interception script](./interception-scripts.md) is a very powerful tool that enables developers to 
control many different aspects of the authentication process.

It is possible to use external libraries in interception scripts. It is possible to use external libraries Java 
libraries in [pure Java](./interception-scripts.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-script) based interception script. If the
interception script is implemented in Jython then it is possible to 
[use external Java libraries](./interception-scripts.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-jython-script) as well as
