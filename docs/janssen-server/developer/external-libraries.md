# Using External Libraries In Interception Scripts

Janssen Server [Interception script](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md) is a powerful tool that enables developers to
control many different aspects of the authentication process.

It is possible to use external Java libraries in [pure Java](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-script) based interception scripts. If the interception script is implemented in Jython then it is possible to [use external Java libraries](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-jython-script) as well as [external Python libraries](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-python-libraries-in-a-script)
