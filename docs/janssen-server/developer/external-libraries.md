Janssen Server [Interception script](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md) enables developers to control many aspects of the authentication process.

It is possible to use external libraries in interception scripts. It is possible to use external libraries Java 
libraries in [pure Java](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-script) java based interception script. If the
interception script is implemented in Jython then it is possible to 
[use external Java libraries](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-java-libraries-in-a-jython-script) as well as
[external Python libraries](../../janssen-server/developer/scripts/README.md#using-python-libraries-in-a-script).
