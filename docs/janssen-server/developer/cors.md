# CORS Filter

## Overview

CORS Filter is an implementation of the [W3C's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/).

The CORS Filter works by adding required `Access-Control-*` headers to the `HttpServletResponse` object. 
The filter also protects against HTTP response splitting. If a request is invalid or not permitted, the request is 
rejected with HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden).

The minimal configuration required to use the CORS Filter is shown below, and is already added to the `web.xml` in `jans-auth.war`. 
The filter name is `io.jans.as.server.filter.CorsFilter`.

```
	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
		<url-pattern />
	</filter-mapping>

```

## Configure CORS

CORS can be configured in Jans Server using `Jans TUI`. Follow these steps:

1. Open `Jans TUI` using `/opt/jans/jans-cli/jans_cli_tui.py` command.
2. Go to `Auth Server > Properties` and select `corsConfigurationFilters`
3. This will display the CORS Configuration Filter parameters, as shown below:

5. Define and configure the parameters.
6. Click `save` at the bottom of the page.


## Parameters supported by CORS Filters

CORS Filter supports the following initialization parameters:

|Attribute |	Description|
|-|-|
|corsAllowedOrigins|A list of origins that are allowed to access the resource. A `*` can be specified to enable access to resource from any origin. Otherwise, a whitelist of comma separated origins can be provided. Eg: `http://www.w3.org`, `https://www.apache.org.` Defaults: `*` (Any origin is allowed to access the resource).|
|corsAllowedMethods|A comma separated list of HTTP methods that can be used to access the resource, using cross-origin requests. These are the methods which will also be included as part of Access-Control-Allow-Methods header in pre-flight response. Eg: `GET`, `POST`. Defaults: `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`|
|corsExposedHeaders|A comma separated list of request headers that can be used when making an actual request. These headers will also be returned as part of Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in a pre-flight response. Eg: `Origin, Accept`. Defaults: `Origin, Accept, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers`|
|corsSupportCredentials|A flag that indicates whether the resource supports user credentials. This flag is exposed as part of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header in a pre-flight response. It helps browser determine whether or not an actual request can be made using credentials. Defaults: `true`|
|corsLoggingEnabled|Value to enable logging, Setting the value to `False` will disable logging. Defaults: `true`|
|corsPreflightMaxAge|The duration in seconds the browser is allowed to cache the result of the pre-flight request. This will be included as part of the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header in the pre-flight response. A negative value will prevent the CORS Filter from adding this response header to the pre-flight response. Defaults: `1800`|
|corsRequestDecorate|A flag to control if CORS specific attributes should be added to the HttpServletRequest object. Defaults: `true`|
