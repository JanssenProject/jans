# SCIM Logs

Logs can be found under `/opt/jans/jetty/jans-scim/logs` in your Janssen Server. The default logging level is `INFO` but this can be changed to any of `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, OR `ERROR` via TUI.

To do so launch TUI, e.g. `jans tui`, and navigate to SCIM tab. Then in "Logging Level" select the desired option. Finally hit "Save".
