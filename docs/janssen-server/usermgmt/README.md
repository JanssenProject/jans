# Local User Management

In this document we will cover managing people in the Jans Server's LDAP Directory, Jans CLI / TUI and using SCIM.

=== "Manage Data using DB Browser"

    You can manage your Janssen Server data using external tool provided by specific DB. For example, to manage LDAP data, Jump into [Manage data in Jans LDAP](#manage-data-in-jans-ldap) section for guidelines.

=== "User Management using SCIM"

    SCIM allows many ways to manage users data. Jump into the [SCIM User Management](../config-guide/scim-config/user-config.md) for guidelines of SCIM operations. To know how SCIM works in Janssen Server, read more from [here](../scim/README.md).
    
=== "Manage External Data Sources Using Link"

    Janssen Server allows connecting external data sources using Jans Link. Syncing people and attributes from a backend server speeds up authentication transactions. It is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of attributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. Transformations are stored locally in Janssen Server. Read out [Link Guide](../link/README.md) to know more details on it.
    

## Manage Data in RDBMS

If you choose any of RDBMS like mysql, or postgreSQL, you can explore your jans server database using any tool that are supported by the regarding RDBMS. Let's see how we can connect PostgreSQL DB from jans server to your local PC.

## Manage data in Jans LDAP

All the data generated by the Jans Server is stored in the local LDAP server included in every deployment. This includes OpenID Connect client data, session data, tokens, user data, and more.

Use an LDAP browser like [JXplorer](http://jxplorer.org/) or [Apache Directory Studio](https://directory.apache.org/studio/) and can find the configuration in `/etc/jans/conf/jans-ldap.properties`, e.g.:

For Jans OpenDJ, it will look like this:

```
bindDN: cn=directory manager
bindPassword: rmQQI/sax0U=
servers: localhost:1636
```

Establish a tunnel from your computer to the target Jans Server's LDAP. Tunneling is required because Jans Server's LDAP port, 1636, is not exposed to the internet.

In the below example we are showing how to connect and use Jans Server's internal LDAP server with any LDAP browser.

* Sign in with `sudo su -`
* Create tunnel:
* `ssh -fNL 5902:localhost:1636 [username]@[ip_of_Jans_server]`
* Open LDAP browser
* Create new connection

* Perform authentication. 'Password' is the the password of 'admin' user.

* Browse ldap and go to `ou=people`.
