/**
 * An interface that exhibits operations to manipulate Fido2Device SCIM resources.
 *
 * <p>The parameters <i>attrsList</i> and <i>excludedAttrsList</i> found in methods of this interface are aimed at
 * specifying the "attributes" and "excludedAttributes" query params regarded in section 3.9 of SCIM spec protocol document
 * (RFC 7644).</p>
 * <p>Every SCIM service operation that returns resources (e.g Users, Groups, etc.) offers the possibility to specify
 * which attributes can be included for every resource part of the response. The default behavior is returning those attributes
 * that according to the resource Schema have returnability = "always" in addition to those with returnability = "default".</p>
 * <p><i><b>attrsList</b></i> is used to override the default attribute set, so when supplying a not-null or not empty String,
 * the attributes included in the resource(s) of the response will be those with returnability = "always" as well as those
 * specified by <i>attrsList</i>.</p>
 * <p>This parameter consists of  a comma-separated list of attribute names. An example of a valid value for <i>attrsList</i>
 * when the resource of interest is User, could be: <code>userName, active, name.familyName, addresses,  emails.value, emails.type,
 * urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:gluu:2.0:User:myCustomAttribute</code></p>
 * <p>Note that attributes marked with returnability = "never" (such as a User password) will always be filtered out from
 * the output, so including such attributes in <i>attrsList</i> has no effect.</p>
 * <p><i><b>excludedAttrsList</b></i> is used to specify the set of attributes that should be excluded from the default
 * attribute set. In this sense, the resources found in the response will include the attributes whose returnability = "always"
 * in addition to those with returnability = "default" except for those included in <i>excludedAttrsList</i>. As with
 * <i>attrsList</i>, this parameter must be in the form of a comma-separated list of attribute names.</p>
 * <p><i>attrsList</i> and <i>excludedAttrsList</i> are mutually exclusive: if both are provided only <i>attrsList</i>
 * will be taken into account to compute the output attribute set.</p>
