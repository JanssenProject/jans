## Schema

### Required

- `alg` (String) The specific cryptographic algorithm used with the key.
- `exp` (Number) Contains the token expiration timestamp
- `kid` (String) The unique identifier for the key.
- `kty` (String) The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key.
- `use` (String) How the key was meant to be used; sig represents the signature.

### Optional

- `crv` (String) The crv member identifies the cryptographic curve used with the key. Values defined 
						by this specification are P-256, P-384 and P-521. Additional crv values MAY be used, provided 
						they are understood by implementations using that Elliptic Curve key. The crv value is case 
						sensitive.
- `descr` (String) key description.
- `e` (String) The exponent for the RSA public key.
- `n` (String) The modulus for the RSA public key.
- `name` (String) Name of the key.
- `x` (String) The x member contains the x coordinate for the elliptic curve point. It is represented 
						as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big endian representation.
- `x5c` (List of String) The x.509 certificate chain. The first entry in the array is the certificate to use 
						for token verification; the other certificates can be used to verify this first certificate.
- `y` (String) The y member contains the y coordinate for the elliptic curve point. It is represented 
						as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big endian representation.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
