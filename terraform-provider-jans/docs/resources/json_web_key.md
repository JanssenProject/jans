# jans_json_web_key (Resource)

Resource for managing JSON Web Keys (JWK) in the Janssen authorization server.
JWKs are used for signing and encrypting tokens in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows.

## Example Usage

### ECDH-ES Encryption Key

```terraform
resource "jans_json_web_key" "ecdh_encryption" {
  descr = "Encryption Key: ECDH-ES using Concat KDF and CEK wrapped with A256KW"
  kty   = "EC"
  use   = "enc"
  crv   = "P-256"
  kid   = "96cb1725-8fdb-4325-06d1-2ebf9adf4fa0_enc_ecdh-es+a256kw"
  name  = "id_token ECDH-ES+A256KW Encryption Key"
  x     = "Z3xu2YigqjJPpvFvQs_qMIhKDTGShQD5XPGpbhqXc8w"
  y     = "kjMUo48I0sGd65k1nRPgRe8r1AnCqrblmi9pPhYHaug"
  exp   = 2051222400000  # January 1, 2035 00:00:00 UTC
  alg   = "ECDH-ES+A256KW"
  
  x5c = [
    "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"
  ]
}
```

### RSA Signing Key

```terraform
resource "jans_json_web_key" "rsa_signing" {
  descr = "RSA Signing Key for ID Tokens"
  kty   = "RSA"
  use   = "sig"
  kid   = "rsa-sig-key-001"
  name  = "RS256 Signing Key"
  alg   = "RS256"
  exp   = 2051222400000  # January 1, 2035 00:00:00 UTC
  n     = "0vx7agoebGcQSuuPiLJXZptN9nndrQmbXEps2..."
  e     = "AQAB"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `alg` (String) The specific cryptographic algorithm used with the key.
- `exp` (Number) Contains the token expiration timestamp
- `kid` (String) The unique identifier for the key.
- `kty` (String) The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key.
- `use` (String) How the key was meant to be used; sig represents the signature.

### Optional

- `crv` (String) The crv member identifies the cryptographic curve used with the key. Values defined by this specification are P-256, P-384 and P-521. Additional crv values MAY be used, provided they are understood by implementations using that Elliptic Curve key. The crv value is case sensitive.
- `descr` (String) key description.
- `e` (String) The exponent for the RSA public key.
- `key_ops_type` (List of String) The key operations type.
- `n` (String) The modulus for the RSA public key.
- `name` (String) Name of the key.
- `x` (String) The x member contains the x coordinate for the elliptic curve point. It is represented as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big-endian representation.
- `x5c` (List of String) The x.509 certificate chain. The first entry in the array is the certificate to use for token verification; the other certificates can be used to verify this first certificate.
- `y` (String) The y member contains the y coordinate for the elliptic curve point. It is represented as the base64url encoding of the coordinate's big-endian representation.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
