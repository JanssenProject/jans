description: |-
  Resource for revoking all user sessions. This is a command-style resource that revokes sessions on create/update.
  This resource revokes all active sessions for a specific user identified by their DN (Distinguished Name).
  Use this for security operations such as forcing user logout, responding to security incidents, or
  implementing session management policies. The resource supports triggers to re-execute revocation
  when specified values change.
  Example Usage
  
  # Revoke all sessions for a specific user
  resource "jans_session_revocation" "revoke_user" {
    user_dn = "inum=user123,ou=people,o=jans"
  }
  
  # Conditional revocation with triggers
  resource "jans_session_revocation" "security_incident" {
    user_dn = var.compromised_user_dn
  
    triggers = {
      incident_id = var.security_incident_id
      timestamp   = timestamp()
    }
  }
  
  # Revoke sessions when user status changes
  resource "jans_session_revocation" "on_deactivation" {
    user_dn = jans_user.admin.dn
  
    triggers = {
      user_status = jans_user.admin.status
    }
  }
  
  OAuth Scopes Required
  revoke_sessionhttps://jans.io/oauth/jans-auth-server/session.delete

  Known Issues
  None currently known. The resource correctly handles both successful revocations and 404 responses
  for non-existent users.

# jans_session_revocation (Resource)

Resource for revoking all user sessions. This is a command-style resource that revokes sessions on create/update.

This resource revokes all active sessions for a specific user identified by their DN (Distinguished Name).

implementing session management policies. The resource supports triggers to re-execute revocation
when specified values change.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Revoke all sessions for a specific user
resource "jans_session_revocation" "revoke_user" {
  user_dn = "inum=user123,ou=people,o=jans"
}

# Conditional revocation with triggers
resource "jans_session_revocation" "security_incident" {
  user_dn = var.compromised_user_dn

  triggers = {
    incident_id = var.security_incident_id
    timestamp   = timestamp()
  }
}

# Revoke sessions when user status changes
resource "jans_session_revocation" "on_deactivation" {
  user_dn = jans_user.admin.dn

  triggers = {
    user_status = jans_user.admin.status
  }
}
```

## OAuth Scopes Required

- `revoke_session`
- `https://jans.io/oauth/jans-auth-server/session.delete`

Note: Both scopes must be granted to the OAuth client for this resource to work.

## Known Issues

None currently known. The resource correctly handles both successful revocations and 404 responses
for non-existent users.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Janssen Provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    jans = {
      source = "jans/jans"
    }
  }
}

provider "jans" {
  url           = "https://moabu-noble-sawfish.gluu.info"
  client_id     = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
  insecure_client = true  # Only for development/testing
}

# Example 1: Revoke sessions for a specific user
resource "jans_session_revocation" "revoke_user_sessions" {
  user_dn = "inum=user123,ou=people,o=jans"
}

# Example 2: Conditional session revocation with triggers
resource "jans_session_revocation" "security_incident" {
  user_dn = var.compromised_user_dn

  triggers = {
    # Trigger revocation when incident ID changes
    incident_id = var.security_incident_id
    timestamp   = timestamp()
  }
}

# Example 3: Revoke sessions on user role change
resource "jans_user" "admin_user" {
  user_id     = "admin.user"
  given_name  = "Admin"
  family_name = "User"
  mail        = "admin@example.com"
  display_name = "Admin User"
  user_password = var.user_password
  status = "active"
}

# Automatically revoke sessions when user is deactivated
resource "jans_session_revocation" "on_user_deactivation" {
  user_dn = jans_user.admin_user.dn

  triggers = {
    # Revoke when user status changes
    user_status = jans_user.admin_user.status
  }

  # This will execute whenever the user status changes
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [jans_user.admin_user.status]
  }
}

# Variables
variable "compromised_user_dn" {
  description = "DN of user with compromised account"
  type        = string
  default     = "inum=compromised-user,ou=people,o=jans"
}

variable "security_incident_id" {
  description = "Security incident tracking ID"
  type        = string
  default     = "INC-2025-001"
}

variable "user_password" {
  description = "User password"
  type        = string
