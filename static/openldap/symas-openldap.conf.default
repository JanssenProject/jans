# This file contains configuration information for Symas OpenLDAP.
# Refer to the comments just before each variable to determine proper
# settings.
#
# 
# RUN_SLAPD - Control the ldap server daemon.
# A value of Y will cause the ldap server daemon to be started.
# Any other value will prevent it from being started.
RUN_SLAPD=Y

# SLAPD_USER, SLAPD_GROUP - Set the user group id of the ldap
# server daemon. Generally these are best left set to root,but
# some folks like to change the ID for security reasons. If you
# do this, make sure the various directories and files used by
# slapd have the appropriate access permissions.
#SLAPD_USER=root
#SLAPD_GROUP=root

#
# HOST_LIST - The list of listeners the ldap demon should start.
# The value needs to be a quoted, space-separated list of ldap
# URIs. For example:
#      HOST_LIST="ldap:/// ldaps:/// ldapi:///"
# will cause the ldap daemon to start a standard ldap listener
# on port 389, an SSL listener on port 636, and a listener on
# a UNIX domain socket.
HOST_LIST="ldap:///"

# EXTRA_SLAPD_ARGS - Extra arguments for slapd. Use this variable
# to hold extra flags and parameters for the slapd command line.
# For example, to specify the location of the dynamic config
# directory:
# EXTRA_SLAPD_ARGS="-F /opt/symas/etc/openldap/slapd.d"
EXTRA_SLAPD_ARGS=

#
# SOL_PRELOAD - Pre-load a library when starting slapd. Use this
# variable to specify a library to be pre-loaded when starting
# slapd. The most common use for this is to use alternate memory
# allocation libraries, such as libtcmalloc.
# For example, use the following statement to use the libtcmalloc
# allocator:
# SOL_PRELOAD=/opt/symas/lib64/libtcmalloc.so
#SOL_PRELOAD=

#
# PID_FILE - Usefull when running multiple instances of OpenLDAP, 
# this variable sets the location of the slapd process id file.
#PID_FILE="/var/symas/run/slapd.pid"
#PID_FILE=

#
# SLAPD_TIMEOUT - How long to wait for slapd to exit when stopping, in
# seconds.
SLAPD_TIMEOUT=300

#
# BIN and LIB - select which binaries and libraries to use,
# for architectures where several possible ABIs may be available.
BIN=/opt/symas/bin
LIB=/opt/symas/lib64

#
# ulimit -n <integer> (Max number of file descriptors) - Some systems
# (e.g. SuSE) require the limit to be set here before starting slapd.
#ulimit -n 2048

#
# ulimit -v <integer (kb)> (The maximum amount of virtual memory 
# available to the process). Some operating systems (e.g. SuSE) require
# the maximum virtual memory size to be set here before starting slapd.
#ulimit -v 1000000
