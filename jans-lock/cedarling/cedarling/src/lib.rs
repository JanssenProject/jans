//! # Cedarling
//! The Cedarling is a performant local authorization service that runs the Rust Cedar Engine.
//! Cedar policies and schema are loaded at startup from a locally cached "Policy Store".
//! In simple terms, the Cedarling returns the answer: should the application allow this action on this resource given these JWT tokens.
//! "Fit for purpose" policies help developers build a better user experience.
//! For example, why display form fields that a user is not authorized to see?
//! The Cedarling is a more productive and flexible way to handle authorization.
