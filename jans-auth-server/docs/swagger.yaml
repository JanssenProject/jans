    description: Janssen Authorization Server is an open source OpenID Connect Provider (OP) and UMA Authorization Server (AS). The project also includes OpenID Connect Client code which can be used by websites to validate tokens. Server currently implements all required aspects of the OpenID Connect stack, including an OAuth 2.0 authorization server, Simple Web Discovery, Dynamic Client Registration, JSON Web Tokens, JSON Web Keys, and User Info Endpoint. Server is tightly coupled with Gluu Admin UI.

                      have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client
                      can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside
                      of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation. The jwks_uri
                      and jwks parameters must not be used together.
