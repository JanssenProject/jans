This list of steps needed to do to enable DUO person authentication module.

1. This module depends on python libraries. In order to use it we need to install Jython. Please use next articles to proper Jython installation:
    - Installation notest: http://ox.gluu.org/doku.php?id=oxtauth:customauthscript#jython_installation_optional
    - Jython integration: http://ox.gluu.org/doku.php?id=oxtauth:customauthscript#jython_python_integration

2. Copy required python libraries from ./lib folder to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/python folder.

3. Prepare DUO creds file /etc/certs/duo_creds.json with ikey, akey, skey

4. Confire new custom module in oxTrust:
    - Log into oxTrust with administrative permissions.
    - Open "Configuration→Manage Custom Scripts" page.
    - Select "Person Authentication" tab.
    - Click on "Add custom script configuration" link.
    - Enter name = duo
    - Enter level = 0-100 (priority of this method).
    - Select usage type "Interactive".
    - Add custom required and optional properties which specified in README.txt.
    - Copy/paste script from DuoPersonAuthentication.py.
    - Activate it via "Enabled" checkbox.
    - Click "Update" button at the bottom of this page.

5. Configure oxAuth to use DUO authentication by default:
    - Log into oxTrust with administrative permissions.
    - Open "Configuration→Manage Authentication" page.
    - Scroll to "Default Authentication Method" panel. Select "duo" authentication mode.
    - Click "Update" button at the bottom of this page.

6. Try to log in using DUO authentication method:
    - Wait 30 seconds and try to log in again. During this time oxAuth reload list of available person authentication modules.
    - Open second browser or second browsing session and try to log in again. It's better to try to do that from another browser session because we can return back to previous authentication method if something will go wrong.

7. This step is an optional. We need to define SMTP configuration if we are plaaning to use audit_group property. In order to set SMTP configuration
   we need to do:
    - Open "Configuration"->"Organization configuration" page.
    - Scroll down to "SMTP Server Configuration" section.
    - Fill SMTP configuration parameters.
    - Click "Test Configuration" in order to verify SMTP configuration.
    - Click "Update" button at the bottom of this page.
    - Restart tomcat in order to instruct oxAuth to use new SMTP configuration.

There are log messages in this custom authentication script. In order to debug this module we can use command like this:
tail -f /opt/tomcat/logs/wrapper.log | grep "Duo"
