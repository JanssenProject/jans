/**
 * <p>
 * The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an
 * intermediary between the client and resource owner. Instead of requesting
 * authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the
 * resource owner to an authorization server (via its user- agent as defined in
 * [RFC2616]), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with
 * the authorization code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the authorization
 * code, the authorization server authenticates the resource owner and obtains
 * authorization. Because the resource owner only authenticates with the
 * authorization server, the resource owner's credentials are never shared with
 * the client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The authorization code provides a few important security benefits such as the
 * ability to authenticate the client, and the transmission of the access token
 * directly to the client without passing it through the resource owner's
 * user-agent, potentially exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
 * </p>
