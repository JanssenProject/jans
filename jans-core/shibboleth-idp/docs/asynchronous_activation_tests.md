# TrustRelationship Asynchronous Activation — Test Plan

Companion to [`asynchronous_activation.md`](./asynchronous_activation.md). This plan drives an
**incremental, dependency-ordered, test-first** implementation of the **Activation Coordination** bounded
context (`io.jans.shibboleth.activation`): each group relies only on behaviour proven by an **earlier**
group, so the suite can be implemented and green-barred top-to-bottom without forward references.

Unlike the `TrustRelationship` plan, this context is **greenfield** — the classes are stubs today, so
**every coverage box starts unticked**. Tick a box (`- [x]`) once a test in the corresponding
`activation` test class exercises the case. This document is the guardrail the code is written against.

---

## Conventions

- **Each case = a method name + a `@DisplayName`.** The `####` heading holds the case ID and the generated
  method name; the single line beneath the checkbox is a `GIVEN … WHEN … THEN …` sentence written to be
  **pasted verbatim into the JUnit 5 `@DisplayName`** — plain text, ALL-CAPS keywords, no markdown.
- **Naming.** `should<Outcome>_when<Condition>` (camelCase, `should` prefix, `_when` separating the
  condition; the `_when…` clause is dropped when there is no meaningful condition).
- **Result-oriented, not exception-oriented.** Every mutating operation returns a result value, asserted
  with `isSuccess()` + a fluent assert, or `isFailure()` + the concrete error. No test asserts a thrown
  exception for a domain-rule violation. **The result/error type is activation-owned and must not be
  `TrustResult`** (§3 — the coordination context does not depend on trust infrastructure); the concrete
  type is `ActivationResult<T> extends io.jans.common.Result<T>` (see *Open implementation choices* #1).
- **Value objects reject null at construction *and transformation*.** Any VO factory *or* transform that
  ingests a required value returns `ActivationResult<VO>` and rejects null — `of` / `granted` / `create` /
  `Lease.renew` (which additionally rejects being invoked on `Lease.NONE`) — mirroring `EntityId.of` /
  `DisplayName.of`. A VO with a meaningful *absent* form uses a null-object (`Lease.NONE`). No value object
  ever stores a null field. `generate()` (no input) stays direct.
- **Structure.** `Group → Subgroup → Case`, IDs of the form `A<group>.<subgroup>.<case>` (`A` = Activation).
- **Time is injected.** Time-relative behaviour is deterministic in tests. **Domain objects (`Lease`,
  `WorkItem`) receive `now` as an explicit `Instant`** — no ambient clock in the domain. The injectable
  **`TimeSource`** lives at the service layer — the orchestrator and its sweep (G8–G9) — where "now" is
  genuinely ambient. No test reads the wall clock.
- **Immutability.** Value objects (`WorkItemId`, `Lease`) are immutable; a `Lease` renewal yields a **new**
  `Lease`. `WorkItem` transitions yield the item in its new state and never mutate a caller's prior
  reference (immutability preferred, matching the `TrustRelationship` aggregate).
- **No-null lease.** A `WorkItem`'s `lease` is **never** Java `null`; absence is the sentinel `Lease.NONE`
  (§4.1). Asserted with `isNone()` / `isPresent()`, never `== null`.
- **Fixtures & asserts.** New harness (see *Test harness & fixtures to build*): `WorkItemFixtures`,
  `LeaseFixtures`, `WorkerFixtures`, `WorkItemAssert`, an in-memory `WorkItemStore` with compare-and-set
  semantics, a fake `TimeSource`, and a `FinalizeActivationPort` test double standing in for the TR side.
- **Coverage checkbox.** Each case carries `- [ ] covered by test`; tick it once a real test covers it.

### Definitions (used verbatim across cases)

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Episode** | One `ACTIVATING` cycle of a TR. Exactly **one** `WorkItem` per episode; its `WorkItemId` is the fence token (§7b). |
| **Current WorkItem (for a TR)** | The single `WorkItem` the orchestrator's *"current WorkItem for this TR"* pointer names for that TR's live episode. |
| **Alive Worker** | `now - lastHeartbeatAt ≤ heartbeatTtl` (boundary inclusive). |
| **Expired lease** | `now > lease.expiresAt` (boundary at equality is **not** expired). |
| **Lease holder** | The `Worker` named by a `WorkItem`'s current (non-`NONE`) `Lease`. |
| **Stale report** | A report naming a `WorkItem` that is not the TR's current one, or from a Worker that is not the current lease holder. |
| **Terminal state** | `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED`. `PENDING` / `ASSIGNED` are non-terminal. |

### Dependency order (why the groups are numbered this way)

```
G1  identities (WorkItemId, WorkerId) ...... nothing (foundation)
G2  WorkItem enums (Type, State) ........... nothing
G3  Lease + Lease.NONE null object ......... G1 (workerId)
G4  WorkItem creation & invariants ......... G1, G2, G3
G5  WorkItem state machine ................. G4              (claim/heartbeat/report/reclaim/cancel)
G6  Worker entity & liveness ............... G1
G7  Orchestrator: demand -> WorkItem ....... G4, G5          (current-WorkItem pointer; the "queue")
G8  Orchestrator: claim / assignment ....... G5, G6, G7      (atomic claim; mutual exclusion)
G9  Orchestrator: heartbeat & reclaim ...... G8, TimeSource  (lease expiry -> reclaim to PENDING)
G10 Orchestrator: report & fencing ......... G8, G9, FinalizeActivationPort
G11 Orchestrator: cancellation ............. G7, G10
G12 Cross-cutting: delivery, lifecycle, boundary .. all of the above
```

A test that *exercises* a state/behaviour never appears before the group that first *produces* it.

- [x] covered by test

GIVEN two different configured heartbeat TTLs WHEN the same heartbeat age is evaluated against each THEN liveness follows the configured value rather than a hard-coded one

### 7.2 Episode identity & the current pointer

#### A7.2.1 · `shouldPointToNewWorkItem_whenNewEpisodeRequested`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN a TR that already had an episode WHEN a further ActivationRequested arrives THEN a new WorkItem with a new WorkItemId is created and becomes current

#### A7.2.2 · `shouldTreatPriorWorkItemAsNotCurrent_afterNewEpisode`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN a new episode has started for a TR WHEN the previous episode's WorkItem is checked against the current pointer THEN it is no longer current

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN an ASSIGNED WorkItem WHEN its lease is inspected THEN it names exactly one workerId

## Group 10 — Orchestrator: Reporting & Fencing

*Depends on G8, G9 and the FinalizeActivationPort. The fence lives here, not in the TR aggregate (§7, §8 step 6).*

### 10.1 Authoritative report

#### A10.1.1 · `shouldFinalizeAndComplete_whenReportForCurrentItemByHolder`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN a report for the TR's current WorkItem from its lease holder WHEN the orchestrator processes it THEN it invokes finalizeActivation with the diagnostics and marks the WorkItem COMPLETED

#### A10.1.2 · `shouldResolveOpaqueReferenceToTrustId_atBoundary`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN an authoritative report carrying an opaque trustRelationshipId WHEN the orchestrator finalizes THEN it resolves that opaque value to the trust Id only at this boundary before calling finalizeActivation

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN a NO_DATA report was processed WHEN the WorkItem is inspected THEN it is still workable rather than terminal

---

### 12.1 Delivery semantics

#### A12.1.1 · `shouldProcessAtLeastOnce_whenWorkerRetried`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN at-least-once processing of an episode WHEN more than one Worker completes work THEN finalizeActivation takes effect exactly once

### 12.2 Full lifecycle happy paths

#### A12.2.1 · `shouldWalkFullActivationFlow_whenReportedSuccessfully`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN an ActivationRequested WHEN the WorkItem is created and claimed and heartbeated and reported successfully THEN it ends COMPLETED and finalizeActivation was invoked exactly once with success

#### A12.2.2 · `shouldReclaimThenComplete_whenFirstWorkerCrashes`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN an ASSIGNED WorkItem whose first Worker crashes WHEN the lease expires and a second Worker claims and reports THEN the item ends COMPLETED with a single finalize

#### A12.2.3 · `shouldReturnTrToReadyThenRetry_whenActivationFails`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN a reported failure for the current WorkItem WHEN finalize drives the TR to READY and a later episode succeeds THEN the second episode reaches a successful finalize

### 12.3 Boundary / architecture

#### A12.3.1 · `shouldNotDependOnTrustContext_fromActivationDomain`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN the activation model and workers packages WHEN their imports are scanned THEN they depend on no trust-context type except the ActivationDiagnostics finalize contract
*Architecture / dependency guard for §3 (import-scan or ArchUnit). The only permitted trust-side reference is the `ActivationDiagnostics` finalize contract (and its `ActivationStatus`); `Origin` lives in the shared kernel `io.jans.shibboleth.shared`, not the trust context.*

#### A12.3.2 · `shouldReferenceTrOnlyByOpaqueValue`

- [ ] covered by test

GIVEN the activation domain WHEN its TR references are inspected THEN they are opaque values and the trust Id type appears nowhere in the domain

## Test harness & fixtures to build

These support the suite and do not exist yet:

- **`TimeSource`** — an injectable clock (a fake advancing on demand). Every lease-expiry and liveness case
  drives it; no test touches the wall clock. This is the single most load-bearing piece of harness.
- **In-memory `WorkItemStore`** — holds WorkItems by `WorkItemId`, tracks the *"current WorkItem for this
  TR"* pointer, and supports an **atomic compare-and-set** claim (so A8.2.1 can assert mutual exclusion).
- **`FinalizeActivationPort` test double** — stands in for the TR side; records `finalizeActivation`
  invocations (count, diagnostics, resolved trust `Id`) and can be scripted to return success / failure /
  no-data, and to simulate "already left ACTIVATING" for A10.3.2.
- **`WorkItemFixtures` / `LeaseFixtures` / `WorkerFixtures`** — sample WorkItems per state, granted and
  expired leases, alive and expired Workers, all parameterized by the `TimeSource`.
- **`WorkItemAssert`** — fluent assertions: `isPending()`, `isAssigned()`, `isCompleted()`, `isCancelled()`,
  `hasNoLease()`, `hasLeaseHeldBy(workerId)`, `hasId(workItemId)`.
- **Event recorder** — captures emitted domain events (`WorkItemAssigned`, `WorkItemLeaseExpired`,
  `ActivationReported`, `ActivationCancelled`) for the §6 assertions.

## Open implementation choices surfaced by this plan

Decide these before/while implementing; each affects how the cases are written:

1. **Result / error type.** Decided: `ActivationResult<T> extends io.jans.common.Result<T>` with an
   `ActivationError` base (`RequiredValueMissing`, …), mirroring `TrustResult` / `TrustError`. Value-object
   factories that ingest a required raw value return `ActivationResult` and reject null at construction.
2. **`WorkItem` mutability.** Immutable transitions (return a new `WorkItem`, matching the TR aggregate) vs
   in-place state mutation guarded by the store's atomic claim. The plan is written state-outcome-first so
   it holds either way, but the assertion style (new instance vs same instance) depends on this.
3. **Where fencing state lives.** The *"current WorkItem for this TR"* pointer and lease-holder check are
   orchestrator/store responsibilities (§7). The store contract (atomic claim, pointer, expiry sweep) is
   the seam the tests mock — pin it before G7.
4. **Event delivery mechanism.** In-process domain events vs an outbox — out of scope for the domain tests
   (§11), which only assert that events are *emitted*; the transport is covered elsewhere.
5. **Reclaim trigger.** A periodic sweep vs lazy on-access expiry check. The plan drives it via an explicit
   orchestrator sweep entry point so it stays deterministic under the `TimeSource`.
