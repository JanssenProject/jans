jans-pycloudlib contains shared classes and functions to develop Janssen Authorization Server app container runs on the following runtimes:

- [containerd](https://containerd.io/)
- [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)

That being said, jans-pycloudlib is targetting the following platforms:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (first-class citizen)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

We highly recommend to build app container that runs in Kubernetes as it provides more features compared to Docker.
