The oxD client software implements the OpenID Connect and UMA profiles of OAuth 2.0. Most software developers are not federation gurus. oxD makes it easy to properly secure apps without forcing developers to learn the in’s and out’s of the federation protocols.

oxD is a java application that is designed to work as standalone application (without a Web Application Container, e.g. tomcat). In addition to simplifying the interface, oxD externalizes the OpenID Connect and UMA client code. This enables updates to the client code while keeping the application interface the same.

oxD is commercial software that is licensed by Gluu. We offer three versions of oxD, ranging from free to $100 per license per year. Learn more on the [oxD website](https://oxd.gluu.org).
