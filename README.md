## Welcome to the Janssen Project

An open source digital identity platforms that scales, Janssen is a software
distribution of standards-based, developer-friendly components that are
engineered to work together in any cloud.
* Develop your identity solution using low code on
  [Agama Lab](https://agama-lab.gluu.org)
* Use Helm, Rancher, or OpenTofu to deploy your solution in a Kubernetes
  cluster.
* Connect your solution to mobile, web, and API software clients.

Digital identity has a huge technical surface area. As you can see from
the commits on this projects, we write a lot of code. But we don't have to
write everything! Where it's synergistic, the project leverages third party
security components, like Keycloak and Open Policy Agent. We favor security
software that lives under the Linux Foundation umbrella, but other community
governed open source components are ok too.

The Janssen Project is the home of
[Agama](https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/), a programming language
for web login flows. Agama also defines the `.gama` file extension, an archive
format to standardize deployment of Agama code on any IDP.

Janssen is a self-funded project chartered directly under the
Linux Foundation. It is recognized as a
[Digital Public Good](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10470) by the
[DPGA](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/). The core contributors of the Janssen
Project are the [Gluu team](https://gluu.org), who monetize a commercial
distribution Janssen [Gluu Flex](https://gluu.org/flex).

## Janssen Components

#### Internal

1. **[Jans Auth Server](jans-auth-server)**: A very complete Java OAuth
Authorization Server and a [certified](https://openid.net/certification/)
OpenID Connect Provider. It's the
upstream open-source core of [Gluu Flex](https://gluu.org/flex).

1. **[Agama](https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/)**: Agama offers an
interoperable way to design authentication flows, coded in a DSL purpose-built
for writing identity journeys.

1. **[Jans FIDO](jans-fido2)**: Enables end-users to enroll and
authenticate with passkeys and other FIDO authenticators.

1. **[Jans SCIM](jans-scim)**: [SCIM](http://www.simplecloud.info/) JSON/REST
[API](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/reference/openapi/) for user
management, including associated FIDO devices.

1. **[Jans Config API](jans-config-api)**: Config API is a
RESTful control plane for all Janssen components.

1. **[Text UI ("TUI")](jans-cli-tui)**: Command line and interactive
configuration tools to help you correctly call the Config API.

1. **[Jans Chip](demos/jans-chip)**: Sample iOS and Android mobile applications
that implement the full OAuth and FIDO security stack for app integrity,  
client constrained access tokens, and user presence.

1. **[Jans Tarp](demos/jans-tarp)**: An OpenID Connect RP test website that runs
as a browser plugin in Chrome or Firefox.

1. **[Jans Lock](jans-lock)**: A Pub/Sub client that retrieves the latest
data about OAuth access and transaction tokens and updates OPA.

#### External

1. **[Keycloak](https://www.cncf.io/projects/keycloak/)**: provides an array of
out of the box IAM services in a single lightweight container image. It's handy
for many workforce requirements like SAML. The Janssen authenticator module
(SPI) simplifies SSO across Janssen and Keycloak websites.

1. **[Open Policy Agent](https://www.cncf.io/projects/open-policy-agent-opa/)**:
A general-purpose policy engine that runs next to the services that need
external authorization. Jans Lock runs next to OPA to keep the data and policies
up to date.

## Installation

You can install Janssen in a Kubernetes cluster or as a single VM. Check out the
[Janssen Documentation](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/install/) for all
the details.

### Janssen History

In 2020, [Gluu](https://gluu.org) decided to give contributors a role in the
governance and collaborated with the Linux Foundation to charter the Janssen
Project. The initial software contribution for the Janssen Project was a fork of
the "Gluu Server". Subsequently, the Janssen Project developers added a new
configuration control plane, tools, demos, documentation, packaging and
deployment assets.

### Why the name Janssen?

Pigeons (or doves...) are universally regarded as a symbol of peace--which I
think everyone can agree we need more of today. But pigeons are also really fast,
capable of flying 1000 kilometers in a single day, powered by
a handful of seeds. The **Janssen brothers of Arendonk** in Belgium bred the
world's fastest family of racing pigeons. Janssen racing pigeons revolutionized
the sport. The Janssen Project seeks to revolutionize how open-source
digital identity scales in the clouds.
