## Welcome to the Janssen Project

[![The Linux Foundation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Member-The%20Linux%20Foundation-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/the-janssen-project-takes-on-worlds-most-demanding-digital-trust-challenges-at-linux-foundation)
[![DPGA](https://img.shields.io/badge/DPGA-Digital%20Public%20Good-green?style=flat-square)](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/a/10470)

Janssen is a self-funded project chartered directly under the Linux Foundation
to foster the development of enterprise digital identity and access management 
infrastructure. As the lead Contributors, the [Gluu team](https://gluu.org) drives the 
priorities on a day-to-day basis, governed and guided by the Janssen community 
Technical Steering Commitee.

There are several Janssen Components in different stages of development, from demos 
to stable releases. Janssen Project software has batteries included. You 
will find binaries, cloud native deployment assets, documentation and more-- 
enabling you to build a product or mission critical cybersecurity service with 
Janssen software.

If your enteprise needs Janssen for a production deployment, Gluu offers a 
commercial distribution of Janssen Project Components called 
[Gluu Flex](https://gluu.org/flex) and [hosting](https://gluu.org/solo).

### Janssen History

In 2020, [Gluu](https://gluu.org) decided to give contributors a role in the
governance and collaborated with the Linux Foundation to charter the Janssen
Project. The initial software contribution for the Janssen Project was a fork of
the Gluu Server version 4. Subsequently, the Janssen Project developers added a new
configuration control plane, tools, demos, documentation, packaging and
deployment assets.

### Why the name Janssen?

Pigeons (or doves...) are universally regarded as a symbol of peace--which 
we need more of today. But pigeons are also really fast,
capable of flying 1000 kilometers in a single day, powered by
a handful of seeds. The **Janssen brothers of Arendonk** in Belgium bred the
world's fastest family of racing pigeons. Janssen racing pigeons revolutionized
the sport. The Janssen Project seeks to revolutionize how open-source
digital identity scales in the clouds.
