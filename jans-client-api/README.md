# jans-client-api

## Introduction

jans-client-api is a middleware service which can be used by web application developers to facilitate user authentication and authorization with an external [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) identity provider. It includes the server which is a simple REST application designed to work over the web (via https), making it possible for many apps across many servers to leverage a central jans-client-api service for [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) security.

## Installation

### Source Install

If you're a Java geek, you can build the jans-client-api server using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org). The code is available in [Github](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-client-api).

```
git clone https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans-client-api.git
cd jans-client-api
mvn clean install -X
```

After the built is finished `jans-client-api-server-distribution.zip` is generated in `${JANS_CLIENT_API_HOME}/server/target/`. 

### Maven Repository

The distribution zip can be directly downloaded from maven repository `https://maven.jans.io/maven/io/jans/jans-client-api-server/<version>/jans-client-api-server-<version>-distribution.zip`.

#### To run jans-client-api-server:

1. Create a new directory ($JANS_CLIENT_API_SERVER_HOME) with appropriate name and unzip the downloaded `jans-client-api-server-<version>-distribution.zip` into it.

1. Change directory to `$JANS_CLIENT_API_SERVER_HOME/conf` folder and edit client-api-server.yml file to make necessary configuration changes (like setting correct absolute path of `client-api-server.keystore` in keyStorePath property etc.)

1. Now go to $JANS_CLIENT_API_SERVER_HOME/bin folder and start server using below command.

Windows:

```
client-api-start.bat
```

Linux:

```
sh client-api-start.sh
```

After `jans-client-api` server is started, status can be checked using `health-check` url: https://localhost:8443/health-check.
